title: 'NFDI4Microbiota and DZIF: Linux basics and scripting for bioinformatics'
description: Increasingly, physicians and biologists are facing large amounts of data,
  that can no longer be analyzed "by hand". In many research fields, bioinformatics
  contributes both general and specific algorithms implemented in software packages
  that simplify the interpretation of the data, or allow a deeper analysis.  Often,
  bioinformatics software lacks a user-friendly graphical interface. The success of
  programs such as BLAST or BWA shows, however, that this does not have to be an obstacle.
  While the use of command line tools at first sight might appear complicated, it
  provides excellent opportunities to automate repetitive tasks and analysis steps
  into pipelines.   The aim of the workshop "Linux basics and scripting for bioinformatics"
  is to lay a foundation for the automated application of (bioinformatics) programs
  for the participants. Accordingly, interested biologists and physicians and other
  people interested, are invited to participate in a hands-on, in-person workshop,
  where they can become familiar with the Linux environment and its associated landscape,
  using common bioinformatics tools as examples for creating shell scripts. The last
  day of the workshop will cover the fundamentals of the Slurm job scheduler, specifically
  as used in the HZI cluster, although this material is generally applicable. There
  will also be time available to allow participants to discuss their own bioinformatics
  problems.   The course assumes no Linux knowledge, and will be taught in English.
  All participants will receive a certificate of attendance.   The course will be
  held in the BRICS building (Rebenring 56, 38106 Braunschweig) between Tuesday 26th
  â€“ Thursday 28th November 2024.
