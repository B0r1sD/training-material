    description: |
      There were unusually high rates of TB cases in your country this year. To characterize the underlying
      bacterial strains driving the epidemic, isolates have been sent for whole-genome sequencing.  Doctors and public
      health authorities request information in order to take decisions. In this course it will be demonstrated how
      you would make use of NGS to answer several questions relevant for patient and public health system management
      such as:
        - Are there cases of drug resistant bacteria?
        - Is there transmission of drug resistance?
        - Is there evidence of de novo emergence of resistance?
        - Are there multiple infections per patient?
        - Do we have on-going transmission?

      We hope that at the end of the different training sessions you can answer this question on your own and can apply what you have learnt to your own data!

These series of webinars and tutorials aim at improving basic and applied knowledge associated with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and their applications in the field of Tuberculosis (TB).

The trainings will introduce scalable and reproducible data analysis with Galaxy of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex (MTBC) genomes.

A series of pre-recorded sessions and hands-on tutorials will show:
  - How to differentiate sequencing technologies and which ones are most commonly applied in TB and how **(Day 1)**
  - How NGS can be implement into TB laboratories **(Day 1)**
  - How to do mapping and variant calling **(Day 2)**
  - How to detect drug resistance conferring mutations, build phylogenetic trees and infer tuberculosis transmission **(Day 3)**
  - How to use different web tools dedicated to targeted analysis and what it takes to do bioinformatics **(Day 4)**.

After the trainings all participants are expected to:
  - Describe how NGS is being used in TB research and clinical pratice
  - Extract MTBC genomic variants from short sequencing reads
  - Identify drug resistant mutations
  - Identify genetic relationships and interpret a phylogenetic trees
  - Use web applications designed for M. tuberculosis
