priority: 5
draft: true

pathway:
  - section: "Year 1: Biodiversity data handling and visualisation"
    description: |
      learners will understand how to handle biodiversity data and analyse it, as well as elements of visualisation, identifying the optimal visualisation for a dataset. [SC1.1,SC1.4, SC2.1, SC2.3, SC4.1-3]
    tutorials:
      - name: PAMPA-toolsuite-tutorial
        topic: ecology
      - name: regionalGAM
        topic: ecology
      - name: biodiversity-data-exploration
        topic: ecology
      - name: gbif_cleaning
        topic: ecology

  - section: "Year 2: Metabarcoding and environmental DNA data analysis"
    description: |
      analysis of environmental DNA samples requires integrative analysis of highly diversified samples, and new techniques to scale with the data [SC1.4, SC1.5, SC2.1, SC3.1, SC4.1-4]
    tutorials:
      - name: Obitools-metabarcoding
        topic: ecology

  - section: "Year 3: Species distribution modeling"
    description: |
      As an application of data modeling, we will use species migration and biodiversity to teach learners how to build models for complex data and visualise the results. [SC1.1, SC2.4, SC4.1-4]
