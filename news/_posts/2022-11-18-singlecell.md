Single-cell analysis now has [it's own topic]({% link topics/single-cell/index.md %})! These tutorials were previously part of the [transcriptomics topic]({% link topics/transcriptomics/index.md %}), but due to the amazing efforts by {%- include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="nomadscientist" -%}, {%- include _includes/contributor-badge.html id="mtekman" -%} and others, we now have so many tutorials that they deserve their own dedicated topic!

Exciting new single-cell tutorials are also planned to be added in the near future, so keep your eyes on this hot topic!
