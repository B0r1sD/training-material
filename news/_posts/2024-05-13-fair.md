We are happy to report that over the years of our fruitful collaboration with ELIXIR TeSS, all GTN materials should receive a perfect score on the [FAIR-Checker](https://fair-checker.france-bioinformatique.fr/check).

This achievement is a reflection of our long standing and ongoing commitment to ensuring all of the materials you share with others via the GTN are automatically FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Of course the GTN goes further meeting criteria for FAIR/O, as all of our resources are shared with the community under an Open License.

## Why the GTN?

Amongst other competitors in the bioinformatics training material repository space the GTN is unique, we are the only one (which we're aware of!) receiving a perfect score on the FAIR-Checker.

## For Tutorial Authors

We have not made any new requirements for tutorial authors, simply by contributing a tutorial to the GTN which passes our linting, you can be sure it meets all relevant FAIR criteria due to our infrastructure and automation.

## For Trainers

If you're a trainer, you can be confident that all GTN materials you use in your training are FAIR. Please let your funders know you are meeting these criteria as well!
