Bleep bloop! We have deployed some bots to enable our Matrix regulars
to better engage with the contributions and questions of our users on
the non-Matrix side of the Galaxy-verse.

GTN contributions are summarized daily and delivered to the
[GTN Matrix Lobby](https://app.element.io/#/room/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im),
and [Galaxy Help](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) topics in need of
answering can now be forwarded to the humans in Matrix channels
related to those topics.

The world just got a little smaller!
