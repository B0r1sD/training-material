We are happy to share that a a new imaging tutorial for **Tracking Mitochondria and Capturing Mitoflashes**, is now available in the Galaxy Training Network. 

![Mitoflash Analysis Pipeline]({% link topics/imaging/images/detection-of-mitoflashes/Workflow_mitoflash.png %} "Analysis Pipeline for Tracking Mitochonria and Capturing Mitoflashes. Overview of the workflow for detecting mitoflash using Mitochondrion detection (Step 1), Mitochondrion tracking (Step 2), and Curve fitting to measured intensities (Step 3).")

This tutorial, Detection of Mitoflashes, provides a step-by-step guide on analyzing mitoflash events in mitochondria using Galaxy. Mitoflashes are transient bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, linked to bioenergetic states and physiological processes like muscle contraction and neuronal development. The tutorial explains how to preprocess imaging data, identify mitoflash events, and quantify key parameters (amplitude, duration, and frequency) using informatic tools in Galaxy. It is designed for researchers studying mitochondrial behavior in health and disease, emphasizing accessibility and reproducibility in imaging analysis.
