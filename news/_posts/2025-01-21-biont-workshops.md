# Second round of BioNT organized workshops was happening in 2024

Like last year two [BioNT](https://biont-training.eu/) workshops where organized with the help of the Galaxy training network last year. We enjoyed to kickoff the second round of the basic BioNT curriculum with our RNA-seq and Python workshop. 


The BioNT consortium is dedicated to providing a comprehensive training program and fostering a community for digital skills relevant to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector. All BioNT workshops are hosted online with real time communication via a shared document. Therefore the workshop has besides an instuctor several helpers, replying to questions ans issues raised by the participants during the workshop.

## A practical introduction to bioinformatics and RNA-seq using Galaxy

The second round of the Python workshop was held from the 10th to the 13th of September 2024. Participants could apply via the [event page](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/a-practical-introduction-to-bioinformatics-and-rna-seq-using-galaxy-1359), which also summarized the content and shedule of the workshop. 
In total we had 170 applicants this year, therefore we had to select participants based on three creterions: (1) beeing a job seaker, (2) working in or haveing a connection to an SME and (3) beeing emplyed in and eurpean country.  In total we accepted 61 participants of which 52 activly participated in the workshop. At the end of the Workshop we did hand out 27 certificats.
In total 4 instructors and 7 helpers ensured a well running workshop.

With the huge numbers of applicants, three time as much as the first round, the workshop participants did fit more the requesrments of the BioNT funding.

## From Hero to Zero with Python

The second round of the Python workshop was held from the 17th to the 18th of October 2024. Participants could apply vie the [event page](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/from-zero-to-hero-with-python-1362), which also summarized the content and shedule of the workshop.
