Did you ever wonder which was the number one most used tool in the GTN? There is a new page of [Top Tools]({% link top-tools.html %}) where we list all of the top tools in the GTN, and which tutorials use them. This page is also [available as a JSON API]({{ site.baseurl }}/api/top-tools.json)

Additionally we have exposed them as individual page listings as well, e.g. if you wanted to link to "All GTN Tutorials Using My Tool", you could do that with one of [these pages like Cat1]({{ site.baseurl }}/by-tool/cat1.html)

We hope to connect this to the training materials in more places in the future, e.g. "Find other tutorials using this tool" type annotations automatically. If you have ideas, let us know!
