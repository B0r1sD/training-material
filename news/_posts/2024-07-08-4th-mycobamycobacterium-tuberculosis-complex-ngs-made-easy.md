Tuberculosis (TB) is a big killer in many countries of the world, particularly in those with low and middle income. Next-generation sequencing has been key in improving our understanding of drug resistance acquisition and of transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. Yet, the need for expertise guiding NGS implementation in laboratories and the lack of bioinformatic expertise, are main obstacles hindering the implementation of NGS into TB programs.

We have conceived a training combining pre-recorded webinars and hands-on bioinformatics tutorials, to present state-of-art TB-specific solutions for generating NGS data and its analysis.

On June 10-14th, we delivered the 4th edition of the training to circa 40 people from all over the world, who autonomously followed the webinars and hands-on bioinformatics tutorials and interacted with a panel of experts via real-time chat and live discussion sessions.

Thank you Galaxy!
