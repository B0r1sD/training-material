# Community Pages

# 🎉 Ring in 2025 with the GTN’s Amazing New Feature! 🎉  

We’re absolutely *thrilled* to introduce the fabulous **Community Page**—a glorious new addition that has us cheering! 🎊  

Here’s why we’re so excited: this page **automatically** tracks and celebrates all the incredible resource contributions from our community over time. 🚀 Whether it’s new workflows, fresh training materials, or awesome contributors, everything is summed up for you, hassle-free!  

Gone are the days of frantically piecing together achievements to impress institutes or grant bodies. No more scratching your head at year’s end wondering, *“Wait... what *did* we accomplish?”* GTN gets it. 💡 We know trainers are superheroes juggling this alongside their full-time research or infrastructure roles.  

Now, with sleek live charts, we can *see* how our community shines 🌟—in real time! It’s a joyful reflection of all the hard work, dedication, and collaboration that make this community so special.  

So here’s a huge **THANK YOU** to the GTN team for this spectacular gift! 🥳 You’ve truly embodied the spirit of user-centered design—not just for the scientists using Galaxy, but for those of us building it, too. 💖  

Here’s to an exciting 2024 full of growth, achievements, and community magic! 🎆
