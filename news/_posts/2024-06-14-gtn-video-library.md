Many GTN tutorials already have recordings. These recordings were made by members of the community for a variety of (online) training events.
Up until now, this video library were part of the [Gallantries Project](https://gallantries.github.io/).
We have now integrated this video library directly into the GTN, and made it even **easier to add video recordings** to GTN tutorials or slide decks!
**We welcome video recordings from everybody!**

Please checkout out our FAQs with instructions for adding your own recordings:
