<p>Just by adding the slides, with good speaker notes made from the discussion that already existing
I simply had to add the slides, turn the discussion into speaker notes, and that was it. I was done.
Once the PR was merged, the video was created, and available to watch on the GTN.</p>

<p>The video has perfectly accurate subtitles for anyone who is hard of hearing or d/Deaf, the slides are also available in plain text formats for those who prefer them, all from my contribution of a single, reformatted, markdown file.</p>

<p>We have now added support for <a href="https://workflowhub.eu">WorkflowHub.eu</a> in our <a href="/training-material/workflows/list.html">cross-galaxy workflow search</a> interface that lets you find workflows from around the universe. The support for WorkflowHub helps us showcase all of the best-practice workflows currently available there! These can all be imported and run directly in Galaxy.</p>

<iframe src="/training-material/workflows/embed.html?all=vgp+Delphine+Lariviere" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

<p>The “Load in Galaxy” button uses our <a href="/training-material/news/2023/04/20/my-galaxy-training.html">my.galaxy.training</a> service to let you choose which Galaxy server you’re redirected to. These links will work for any recent Galaxy server.</p>

<h2 id="querying">Querying</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/4494">a request from Paul</a>, more advanced querying was needed.</p>

<p>As such we’ve added a couple of alternative query parameters that you may use:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Query Parameter</th>
      <th>Example Values</th>
      <th>Interpretation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?query=</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?query=single-cell</code></td>
      <td>This will search for the text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">singlecell</code> anywhere in the conjoined fields of title, tags, and authors. This is similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all</code> but will look for exact phrases including spaces, rather than splitting up queries word-by-word.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?all=</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?all=longreads+microbiome</code></td>
      <td>Each term, separated by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> (which is interpreted as a ` ` space character in URL parsing), must appear somewhere in those fields. If any term is missing, that workflow will not be included</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?any=</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?any=longreads+shortread</code></td>
      <td>As long as one of these terms is present, the result will be shown. So long or short read workflows will match this query. (Assuming they’re tagged properly!)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?none=</code></td>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?none=testing+training</code></td>
      <td>If you want to exclude one or more terms, you can list them here.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

Where previously there were two subdomains each with their own sets of tools, there is now a unified subdomain with re-categorized tools that makes sense for users.</p>

<p>The central page was updated for the first time in years, and some excellent workflow and training search widgets were created. This went hand-in-hand with the creation of the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/projects/singlecell/">Galaxy Single Cell Community of Practice page</a>.
This infrastructure connects - for the first time - single cell users from novices performing training in Galaxy, to searching more advanced workflows and tools beyond the training, and finally able to contribute, request tools, provide feedback or join the Community of Practice.</p>

<p>Let’s hear from Wendi about the experience.</p>

<h1 id="what-spawned-this-project">What spawned this project?</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Trying to navigate users through all the quirks of Galaxy when they tried to move outside of the tutorials was challenging, and having to explain why we had two sites that both focused on single cell analysis was also tricky. This subdomain makes it a lot easier to communicate the potential to users - they can immediately see how many different toolsuites are available without being overwhelmed. They don’t have to debate whether to learn R or Python, Seurat or Scanpy - they can just try both! Plus, data formats is the thing that stumps users more than anything. My group was constantly losing track of which tool could do what to convert data formats, and I am absolutely thrilled to have an entire section devoted to these random tools that are so vital to applying the analysis to public or private data.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="what-was-it-like-to-do-this-at-egd-2023-cofest">What was it like to do this at EGD 2023 CoFest?</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>I had no idea how difficult it would be to make what seemed like quite superficial changes to make the tool panels more usable! José was an absolute star, navigating through all of this seamlessly. Pavan kept finding single cell tools under a ton of different metadata titles, so it was also exciting to see just how many different tools were out there and to get them all in the same place. There’s so much more to play with than I realised! Helena jumped in virtually to make these banging widgets to prevent the sites from becoming outdated, and give contributors more of a voice in the site - if anyone shares a workflow tagged #singlecell on any of the Big 3 public instances, it’s now on our single cell page. I’m so glad we had the CoFest though, because getting together all the different single cell sites, getting all the tools that we found in the right spot, it required the entire day and then some and a lot of collaboration. At one point I was literally highlighting tool IDs in a giant list. It just wouldn’t have been feasible virtually. I’m so excited for the next training session to just see how users navigate the new site.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial-list">Tutorial List</h2>

<p>In order to help her keep her tutorial list updated, we turned every tag on the GTN into an embeddable widget</p>

<iframe src="/training-material/tags/10x/embed.html" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

<p>You can embed a tag by using the url format</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/tags/TAG/embed.html"</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="usegalaxy-workflow-list">UseGalaxy.* Workflow List</h2>

<p>We also made a widget for the UseGalaxy.* Workflow List so you can embed the latest and greatest workflows with any given tag/name from any of the UseGalaxy.* servers!</p>

<iframe src="/training-material/workflows/embed.html?query=circos" height="300px" width="100%" class="gtn-embed"></iframe>

This gives you more control over both how the GTN looks, and works, for you.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<p>This will allow users to set their theme with some more granularity! Previously
you could only choose between a few themes, now these have been split into
separate axes giving you more control over how the GTN renders for you.</p>

<h3 id="brightness">Brightness</h3>

<p>Previously you could switch manually between light and dark themes. Now the GTN
will default to an automatic one that switches the GTN to dark mode when your
system preferences requests it.
Alternatively you can override this and choose a light or dark theme as you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="light-theme">Light Theme</h3>

<p>We’ve added a new light theme with a more yellowed background to be less harsh
on the eyes. When the GTN is using the light mode (automatically or manually)
you can toggle between this and the plain white version.</p>

<h3 id="dark-theme">Dark Theme</h3>

<p>Likewise, now when the GTN is using the dark mode (automatically or manually)
you can choose whether it will use the “night” (dark grey) or “midnight” (pure black) themes.</p>

<h3 id="contrast">Contrast</h3>

<p>Have you ever tried to use some applications in high-light environments, such
as outdoors and found them hard to read? Many websites use unfortunately low
contrast. The GTN now has a slider that allows you to select low, normal
(automatic), or high contrast as is your preference. High contrast will make
all elements a bit more contrasting to ensure you can see them more easily in
those environments.</p>

<h3 id="themes-1">Themes!</h3>

<p>Previously if you wanted the Halloween theme it would only exist on a dark
background, but now you can try them out on any background! The same goes for
all other GTN themes, so please feel free to choose whatever colours suit you,
knowing you’ll be able to use the GTN day and night.</p>

<h2 id="data-privacy">Data Privacy</h2>

<p>The GTN collects very limited information on you as a person. Most of our
developers are located in the EU, and live under GDPR. We do not want your personal data at all.</p>

<p>However we do collect very limited statistics (page views), and error logs via
Sentry (whenever errors occur). If you wish to opt-out of this collection, you
are welcome to do so here.</p>

The GTN has you covered with the Pan-Galactic Tool Search that is now available.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: the authors were reminded of
<a href="https://galaxycat.france-bioinformatique.fr/">GalaxyCat</a> which does the same
thing as the GTN but better! Please go use that.</p>

<hr />

<p>We recently received a question online from our colleague <a href="https://github.com/scottcain">Dr. Scott Cain</a>
trying to find the <em>Manta</em> Structural Variant analysis tool amongst the Galaxies. While
his complaints about generic names are very apt (and Galaxy existed before the
phone!) we do still have very generic names in our tools.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is also quite difficult with these large, complex,
JavaScript based web applications. So, the GTN has added a Pan Galactic Tool
Search!</p>

<iframe src="https://genomic.social/@scottcain/110498601155255378/embed" width="100%" height="250">
Scott: Arg! Please don't use common words to name your software projects! First (and a long time ago) you have the fine folks @galaxyproject using that word, then you have the SV caller Manta, making it impossible to answer with a simple google whether manta is available at a public Galaxy hub.
</iframe>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>

<p>The GTN uses the list of <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/use/">Public Galaxy
Servers</a> available from the Hub to construct
the dropdowns you see on Tutorials indicating which servers support a given
tutorial.</p>

<p>Every time the GTN gets deployed (at minimum once a day), we collect a list of
tools that are available from each of those servers. This metadata is available
directly from the GTN (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/psl.json</code>).</p>

<p>When we render a tutorial, we check the list of tools used in that tutorial,
both those annotated by authors, as well as whichever ones are mentioned in the
associated workflows, and list the intersection of what’s available.</p>

<p>Since we had this metadata already available, it was trivial to generate a tool
search which simply searches through this file and lists the relevant servers.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>As the GTN is a static site, so is our search. It takes a second to load the
tool search interface (~7MB uncompressed), but after that you can search more
or less instantaneously through all 15k versions of the 6k known tools we see
across the Galaxy.</p>]]></content><author><name>Helena Rasche</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="new feature" /><category term="gtn" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you ever want to run a tool, but not know where it might be available?

<p>This month we want to highlight the contributions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_L._Hart">Alan L. Hart</a>, an American physician and radiologist who pioneered the use of X-Rays to screen for Tuberculosis. Dr. Hart was one of the first trans men to have a hysterectomy in the US.</p>

<h2 id="tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</h2>

<p>Tuberculosis, mostly caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_tuberculosis"><em>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</em></a>, is 13<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death. It was temporarily decreased to the 2<sup>nd</sup> leading cause of death by an infectious agent, due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Sadly, it retains this position despite being preventable and curable (<span class="citation"><a href="#who_tuberculosis_2023">WHO 2023</a></span>).</p>

<p>Roughly 23% of the world’s population is infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, it claims 1.5 million lives each year (<span class="citation"><a href="#cdc_tuberculosis_2020">CDC 2020</a></span>).</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
  <p>Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health &amp; Science University);
[…]
Hart devoted much of his career to research into and treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 20th century the disease was the biggest killer in America. … Hart was among the first physicians to document how it then spread, via the circulatory system, causing lesions on the kidneys, spine, and brain, eventually resulting in death
[…]
In the early twentieth century [X-Rays] were used to detect bone fractures and tumors, but Hart became interested in their potential for detecting tuberculosis. Since the disease often presented no symptoms in its early stages, x-ray screening was invaluable for early detection.</p>

  <p>In 1937 Hart was hired by the Idaho Tuberculosis Association and later became the state’s Tuberculosis Control Officer. He established up Idaho’s first fixed-location and mobile TB screening clinics and spearheaded the state’s war against tuberculosis. Between 1933 and 1945 Hart traveled extensively through rural Idaho, covering thousands of miles while lecturing, conducting mass TB screenings, training new staff, and treating the effects of the epidemic.</p>

  <p>An experienced and accessible writer, Hart wrote widely for medical journals and popular publications, describing TB for technical and general audiences and giving advice on its prevention, detection, and cure. At the time the word “tuberculosis” carried a social stigma akin to venereal disease, so Hart insisted his clinics be referred to as “chest clinics”, himself as a “chest doctor”, and his patients as “chest patients”. Discretion and compassion were important tools in treating the stigmatised disease.</p>

  <p>In 1943 Hart, now recognised as preeminent in the field of tubercular Roentgenology, compiled his extensive evidence on TB and other x-ray-detectable cases into a definitive compendium, <em>These Mysterious Rays: A Nontechnical Discussion of the Uses of X-rays and Radium, Chiefly in Medicine</em> (pub. Harper &amp; Brothers), still a standard text today. The book was translated into several languages, including Spanish.</p>
