# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

<!-- This is a comment. -->

This tutorial is a follow-up to the 'Single-cell RNA-seq: Case Study' (find it [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/)), we will use the same sample from the previous tutorials. If you haven’t done them yet, it’s highly recommended that you go through them to get an idea how to [prepare a single cell matrix](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/tutorial.html), [combine datasets](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.html) or [filter, plot and process scRNA-seq data](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_basic-pipeline/tutorial.html) to get the data in the form we’ll be working on today.

In this tutorial we will perform trajectory analysis using [monocle3](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/). You can find out more about the theory behind trajectory analysis here /slides/. We have already analysed the trajectory of our sample using ScanPy toolkit in another tutorial: [Trajectory Analysis using Python (Jupyter Notebook) in Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-case_JUPYTER-trajectories/tutorial.html). However, trajectory analysis is quite sensitive and some methods work better for specific datasets. Now you can go through the same steps but using a different method to compare the results, usability and the final outcome! Sounds exciting, let’s dive into that! 

***tip: using tutorial mode***

## Get data
We still work on data from a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction [Bacon et al. 2018](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-JUPYTER-trajectories/tutorial.html#Bacon2018) (see the study in Single Cell Expression Atlas [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and the project submission [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)), making this case study even more comprehensive. 
Monocle3 works great with annotated data, so we will make use of our annotated AnnData object, generated in the previous [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-seq-basic-pipeline/tutorial.html#neighborhood-graph). So you see - all the hard work of processing data was not in vain! We will also need a ‘clean’ expression matrix, extracted from the AnnData object just before we started the processing.
You can find both datasets in this [input history](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/u/j.jakiela/h/monocle3-input-files) or download from Zenodo below.

# Preparing the input files

## Extracting annotations

 As we want to use Monocle for the trajectory analysis, we will have to feed it with cell metadata, gene annotation and expression matrix files (in theory expression matrix alone could do, but then we wouldn’t have all those useful annotations that we were working on so hard!). In order to get those files, we will extract the gene and cell annotations from our AnnData object.

Quick and easy, isn’t it? However, there are some minor changes that we have to make to our files first. 

## Cell metadata
Our current dataset is not just T-cells: as you might remember from the last tutorial, we identified a cluster of macrophages as well. This might be a problem, because the trajectory algorithm will try to find relationships between all the cells (even if they are not necessarily related!), and not only the T-cells that we are interested in. We need to remove those unwanted cell types to make the analysis more biologically relevant.

Manipulate AnnData tool allows you to filter observations or variables and that would be the easiest way to do it! However, we have to think ahead. As we want to use Monocle later on, we will have to provide it with cell metadata, gene annotation and expression matrix files anyway. This is why we extract the annotations first, make changes to them and finally we adjust the expression matrix to the filtered annotations. In that way, we’ll end up with three separate files, ready to be passed onto Monocle3.

Click on `Extracted cell annotations (obs)` file to see a small preview window. This shows you that the column containing the cell types has number 22.  We’ll need that to filter out unwanted cell types!

{: .hands_on}

## Gene annotations
Sometimes certain functionalities require specific indication where the data should be taken from. In case of Monocle3, to allow further genes analysis using one of its functions, it is essential that the names of the genes are stored in a column called ‘gene_short_name’. Therefore, we need to check what is the name of that column in our dataset.

Let’s click on the `Extracted gene annotations (var)` file to see a small preview. We can see that the gene names are in the third column with a header ‘Symbol’. Keep that in mind - we’ll use that in a second!

{: .hands_on}

## Expression matrix
Last, but not least! I would even dare to say that last, but the most important! Actually the expression matrix contains all the values representing expression level of a particular gene in a cell. This is why in theory the expression matrix is the only input file required by Monocle3 - without annotation files the CDS data can still be generated - in fact it will be quite bare, but at least it could be processed. 

So, the values in the expression matrix are just some numbers. But do you remember that we have already done some processing such as normalisation and calculation of principal components on AnnData in the previous tutorial? That affected our expression matrix. Preprocessing is one of the steps in the Monocle3 workflow, so we want to make sure that the calculations are done on a ‘clean’ expression matrix. If we apply too many operations on our raw data, it will be too ‘deformed’ to be reliable. The point of the analysis is to use algorithms that make the enormous amount of data understandable in order to draw meaningful conclusions in accordance with biology. 

So how do we do that?

{: .question}

As you can see, there are way more genes and cells in the unprocessed AnnData file, so the expression matrix is much bigger than we need it to be. If the genes and cells we prepared for Monocle3 are not the same as in the expression matrix, Monocle3 will crash. Therefore, we have to filter that big, clean matrix and adjust it to our already prepared genes and cells files. But first, let’s extract this matrix from the unprocessed AnnData object. 

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Extracting matrix

>    - *"What to inspect?"*: `The full data matrix`

>
{: .hands_on}

If you have a look at the preview of `Unprocessed expression matrix`, you’ll see that the first column contains the cell barcodes, while the first row - the gene IDs. We would like to keep only the values corresponding to the cells and genes that are included in `Cells input data for Monocle3` and `Genes input data for Monocle3`. How do we do it? First, we compare the cell barcodes from `Cells input data for Monocle3` to those in `Unprocessed expression matrix` and ask Galaxy to keep the values of the matrix for which the barcodes in both files are the same. Then, we’ll do the same for gene IDs. So we have to cut the first columns from `Cells input data for Monocle3` and `Genes input data for Monocle3` to be able to compare those columns side by side with the matrix file.

{: .hands_on}

Look at the preview of the output file. First of all, you can see that there are 8570 lines (8569 cells) instead of 31178 cells that were present in the matrix. That’s exactly what we wanted to achieve - now we have information for the T-cells that we had filtered. However, the step that we have already performed left us with the matrix whose first and second columns are the same - let’s get rid of one of those!

>        - *"List of Fields"*: `c1`
> 2. **Rename** {% icon galaxy-pencil %} the output: `Filtered matrix (by cells)`
>
{: .hands_on}

Now we will perform the same steps, but for gene IDs. But gene IDs are currently in the first row, so we need to transpose the matrix, and from there we can repeat the same steps as above, but for gene IDs of course.

{% icon trophy %} Finally! We have prepared all the files to pass them onto the Monocle3 workflow!

# Monocle3 workflow

What will happen with those files that we have been preparing so far? Well, Monocle3 turns the expression matrix, cell and gene annotations into an object called cell_data_set (CDS), which holds single-cell expression data. 

> ### {% icon details %} Details: Input files
> 
> That’s what [Monocle3 documentation](https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/docs/starting/) says about the required three input files:
>    - expression_matrix, a numeric matrix of expression values, where rows are genes, and columns are cells. Must have the same number of columns as the cell_metadata has rows and the same number of rows as the gene_metadata has rows.
>    - cell_metadata, a data frame, where rows are cells, and columns are cell attributes (such as cell type, culture condition, day captured, etc.)
>    - gene_metadata, a data frame, where rows are features (e.g. genes), and columns are gene attributes, such as biotype, gc content, etc. One of its columns should be named "gene_short_name", which represents the gene symbol or simple name (generally used for plotting) for each gene.
