### What is trajectory analysis?

According to [Deconinck et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005) ‘Trajectory inference (TI) methods have emerged as a novel subfield within computational biology to better study the underlying dynamics of a biological process of interest, such as:

cellular development    | differentiation      | immune responses
:---:| :---:| :---:
.image-40[ ![development](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/1_cell_delevopment.png) ] | .image-40[ ![differentiation](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/2_differentiation.png) ] | .image-40[ ![immune](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/3_immune.png) ]

--
TI allows studying how cells evolve from one cell state to another, and subsequently when and how cell fate decisions are made.'

### Clustering, trajectory and pseudotime

.pull-left[
**Clustering** calculates cell similarities to identify group cell types, that can be identified based on the marker genes expressed in each cluster. 

.image-75[ ![clusters](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/5_clusters.png) ]

]
--
.pull-right[
**Trajectory inference** helps to understand how those cell types are related - whether cells differentiate, change in response to stimuli or over time. To infer trajectories, we need data from cells at different points along a path of differentiation. This inferred temporal dimension is known as pseudotime. 
**Pseudotime** measures the cells’ progress through the transition.

### Trajectory inference approaches: Clustering-based (tree based)

.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]

- Try to find stable cell states in the data and afterward connect these states to form a trajectory and map the cells to the formed graph structure 

--

- Clustering approaches: soft K-means, Louvain, non-negative matrix factorization, hierarchical clustering

--

- To connect the clusters to each other, usually a **minimum weight spanning tree (MST)** is constructed (connecting without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight)

--

.image-25[ ![mst](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/mst.png) ]
---
### Trajectory inference approaches: Graph-based
.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]

- Construct a graph representation of the cells and either use graph decomposition to reveal connected and disconnected components, or graph diffusion or traversal methods to construct the trajectory topology

--

- Most methods start by building a **k-nearest neighbors (kNN) ** graph using the Euclidean distance

.image-25[ ![knn](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/knn.png) ]
--

- Diffusion peudotime (DPT) calculates the probability of cells transitioning into each other using random walks from a user-provided root cell and uses the differences between these probabilities as pseudotime


---

### Trajectory inference approaches: **Manifold learning-based**
.footnote[[Deconinck et al. Recent advances in trajectory inference from single-cell omics data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coisb.2021.05.005.)]

- Based on the assumption that data lie on a low-dimentional manifold embedded in a higher-dimentional space

--

- Using principal curves and graphs to obtain smooth trajectories

--

- Usually used dimentionality reduction methods: t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding), UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), PCA (Principal component analysis), ICA (Independent Component Analysis), LSA (Latent semantic analysis)

### MST 
.image-40[ ![mst](../../images/scrna-casestudy-monocle/mst.png) ]

## Formatting: Basic

.pull-left[
<span style="font-size: 35px;font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz';font-weight: normal;text-align: center;">Slide Title</span>

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.org/) and an image:

![Description of the image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

.pull-right[
```markdown
### Slide Title

A list

- Item 1
- Item 2

and numbered list

1. Item
2. Item

Some text with a [link](https://example.org/) and an image:

![Description of the image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
---
```
]

Slides begin with a title `### ...` and should end with a `---`

???

- Slides are written with standard markdown, and begin with a header, and end with three dashes.
- Lists, links, and images are all written with their normal syntax.
- If you're familiar with markdown and already writing your tutorial in it, this should be an easy addition.
- The only differences are the dashes to separate slides, and speaker notes which we'll cover later.

---



### Formatting: Alignment

.left[Left-aligned text]
.center[Centered text]
.right[Right-aligned text]
.left[![Left-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.center[![Centered image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.right[![Right-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]

```markdown
.left[Left-aligned text]
.center[Centered text]
.right[Right-aligned text]
.left[![Left-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.center[![Centered image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
.right[![Right-aligned image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)]
```

???

- Everything can be aligned using several CSS classes which are provided, left, right, and center.
- The classes are added with a dot followed by the class, and then the contents within square brackets.

---



### Formatting: Incremental Text

1. Item

???

- Incremental text can be added

--

2. Appears

???

- And appears incrementally on every slide.

--


Just separate every item with two dashes (`--`)

```markdown
1. Item

--

2. Appears
```

???

- You can accomplish this with two dashes instead of three for incremental slides.
- The dashes should be on their own line, just like the slide separating dashes.

---



### Formatting: Images

.pull-left[
Demo:

10%

.image-10[ ![GTN Logo (tiny)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]

50%

.image-50[ ![GTN Logo (slightly larger)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]

]
.pull-right[
Source:

```markdown
10%
.image-10[
  ![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

50%
.image-50[
  ![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]
```
]


There are [other CSS classes available](https://github.com/galaxyproject{{ site.baseurl }}/blob/main/assets/css/slides.css#L67) for other sizes

???

- There are a number of CSS classes available to use for styling the content you show on your slides.
- Here you can see images scaled to 10% and 50%.
- There are a number of other classes that you can find in the GTN's codebase.

### Formatting: Tables

.pull-left[
Demo:

column1    | column2      | column3
---        | ---          | ---
aaaaaaaaaa | bbbb         | cccc
dddd       | eeeeeeeeeeee | ffff
gggg       | hhhh         | iiiiiiiiii
]

.pull-right[
Source:

```markdown
column1    | column2      | column3
---        | ---          | ---
aaaaaaaaaa | bbbb         | cccc
dddd       | eeeeeeeeeeee | ffff
gggg       | hhhh         | iiiiiiiiii
```
]

By default, tables are left-aligned with text left-aligned.

???

- Tables can be written in the simplified markdown syntax, or using a more complex one that allows for alignment.
- Here a simple table is shown with several columns.
- The tables do not need to be aligned, we just did that in this slide for clarity.

---



### Formatting: Tables with Aligned Text

Different alignments for the individual columns can be controlled with the `:` character

.pull-left[
Demo:

| Tables       | Are      | Cool          |
|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
| left-aligned | centered | right-aligned |
| row2         | row2     | row2          |

]

.pull-right[
Source:
```markdown
| Tables       | Are      | Cool          |
|:-------------|:--------:|--------------:|
| left-aligned | centered | right-aligned |
| row2         | row2     | row2          |
```
]

???

- If you need more complex tables, you can use the colon character to control the alignment.
- If you are presenting numeric data or similar then this can be useful to make the data more readable.

---



### Formatting: Footnotes

Content with footnotes

Source:
```markdown
.footnote[Normal footnote with plenty of text]
```

Demo:

.footnote[Normal footnote with plenty of text]

???

- Footnotes can be used for explanatory notes or adding things like references.
- References are ideal footnote content as they are not necessarily important for comprehension of the slides, but might be useful later for learners.

---



### Formatting: Two Columns

This is achived with the `.pull-left` and `.pull-right` classes.

```markdown
.pull-left[
Some text, as many texts as we want...

or even table

column1 | column2 | column3
--- | --- | ---
row1 | r1c2 | r1c3
row2 | r2c2 | r2c3
row3 | r3c2 | r3c3
]

.pull-right[ ![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png) ]
```

Will be rendered as:

???

- Two column layouts can easily be achieved with the pull left and pull right classes.
- The result of this is demonstrated on the next slide.

### Formatting: Two Columns

.pull-left[
Some text, as many text as we want.....

or even table

column1 | column2 | column3
--- | --- | ---
row1 | r1c2 | r1c3
row2 | r2c2 | r2c3
row3 | r3c2 | r3c3
]

.pull-right[
![GTN Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/GTN-60px.png)
]

???

- Any content can be placed in the left and right columns
- The addition of these classes will wrap all of their contents and place them on the left or right sides.
- The two column layout is an especially good choice if you want to show a graphic and discuss some important points related to it.

---



## Presenter Notes

Allows you to:

- See the next slide before the audience
- See notes you have made on your slides

![Image showing presenter mode](../../images/presenter-mode.png)

???

- Presenter Mode lets you have two windows with the same slides, one with presenter notes and a preview of the upcoming slide.
- When giving presentations with multiple screens or on a projector, this makes life less stressful.
- You can use the presenter notes to remind you, and others, of important content to mention on each slide.

---



### Presenter Notes: Formatting

.left[
<br/>
&#35;&#35;&#35; My Slide
<br/><br/>
Some text!
<br/><br/>
&#63;&#63;&#63;
<br/><br/>
Things written below the ??? are only shown in the
presenter view. Press `p` to bring this up
<br/><br/>
&#45;&#45;&#45;
<br/><br/>
]

???

- Things written below the three question marks are only shown in the presenter view.
- Press P to bring this up, and the question mark to show the presenter view shortcut keys.


---



## Shortcut Keys

- <kbd>?</kbd> activates help
- <kbd>Escape</kbd> leaves help
- <kbd>p</kbd> activates presenter mode
- <kbd>f</kbd> activates full screen mode
- <kbd>c</kbd> clones the slides into a popup

???

- The key to close the help isn't shown in the keyboard shortcuts, but it is the escape key.
- There are a number of other shortcuts which can be useful to know about.
- The clone window function creates a popup with a copy of the slides, this can be used to show the presenter notes on one screen, and the actual slides on another screen that learners can see.

---

## Videos

.pull-left[
- Slides with good speaker notes can be turned into videos
- Enable this in the metadata of the slides:

  ```markdown
  title: "Creating Slides"
  video: true
  questions:
    - "How to format slides?"
  ```

- automatically rendered into narrated videos by the GTN
]

.pull-right[
.image-100[![Screenshot of GTN video player showing a set of slides with a play icon and a transcript](../../images/slides-to-video.png)]
]

???

- The GTN automatically creates videos from selected slide decks.
- Simply by setting video to true to the metadata, slides with sufficiently good speaker notes can be automatically turned into videos.
- The slides have audio narration spoken from the script of the speaker notes by AWS Polly.
- The audio clips, and slides are combined into a video which is then available in the GTN Video Library
