Galaxy *[Special Interest Group](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig)* (**SIG**)s work hard to build and maintain training resources. The GTN has worked hard to acknowledge this and offer nice impact pages to communities.

Here is a list of resources that you can use!

# Maintainer page

Maintaining resources is **fundamental** to the quality and usefulness of any software resource. We do *not* throw code over the wall!

To help topic maintainers to quickly recognise what materials need updating and fixing, **Topic Maintainer Pages** were built.

> <hands-on-title>Go to your topic maintainer page</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Go to any training topic of interest. This will have the form
>    ```
>     https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/<your topic here>
>    ```
> 2. Add a /maintainer to the end of the url.
>    ```
>     https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/<your topic here>/maintainer
>    ```
> 3. Explore the maintainer page!

You may instantly see some key information missing from tutorials, or how long its been since someone checked it! Time to update some materials!

You can see an example from the Single-cell topic below:

# Community Page

Where the **Maintainer page** helps you sustain your community, the **Community page** helps you show off your community. An end-of-year gift in 2024, this page will sift through news, events, and GTN contributions for your community tag of interest (example: single-cell) and provide a beautiful visualization of your efforts.

> 1. Go to any training topic of interest. This will have the form
>    ```
>     https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/<your topic here>

>     https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/<your topic here>/community
