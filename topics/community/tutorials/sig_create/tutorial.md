So you have decided to create a new Special Interest Group (**SIG**)!

> <warning​-title>Do not contribute to software smog!</warning​-title>
> Make sure you have checked if you (# Do you need to make a SIG? LINK HERE SOMEHOW) before creating a new **SIG**! Otherwise, you may be re-inventing an existing **SIG**!
{: .warning}

Let's walk you through making a new Galaxy **SIG**!

# Requirements of a Special Interest Group (SIG)

Before starting a **SIG**, it's important to be aware of the (rather low) requirements for being a **SIG**:

* Must have 2 or more members
* Must maintain a page on the Community Hub with at least:
  * A description of the purpose of the SIG.
  * A clear explanation of how individuals can join and maintain membership.
  * Details of access to the SIG’s communication channels.
  * The current contact/email address for the nominated [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/) representative
* Must manage membership and internal communication for itself.
* Must use at least one public Matrix channel under the Galaxy Matrix space.

# Creating a new SIG

Here are the steps for creating a SIG.

1. Copy an updated SIG page (there's a Template in that folder, work in progress!) from here: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/content/community/sig/. We suggest looking through the different SIG pages to see which one has the type of content you would like and copying that one.
2. Update the text to suit your new SIG
3. Create a Matrix group within the Galaxy Matrix chat forum space.
4. (Optional): Create a mailing list for your SIG: https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/
5. Add your SIG & any relevant links to the [SIG directory](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/content/community/sig/index.md)
6. Send someone to join the Galaxy Community Board, which has tons of resources to support you and also a chat forum on Matrix.

Remember that **SIGs** vary hugely. Some **SIGs** meet and collaborate frequently, while others use their **SIG** to simply provide a key contact individual to represent their group in the Galaxy community. You don't need every link, widget or calendar we create to run a good **SIG**. Just make what fits your group's needs. Above all, think sustainably - someone has to keep things updated, and that someone likely starts with you!

# Sustainability

Remember that if you make a **SIG**, you are responsible for *maintaining* that **SIG**.

This at a minimum includes:

1. A section on the [SIG Directory on the Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/)
2. Your individual SIG page from the Hub that is linked from that directory

This may also include:
1. Your SIG Training page
2. Mailing list

## Ending a SIG

If you collectively decide that the **SIG** is no more, please:

1. Update the [SIG Directory on the Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/)
2. Remove your individual SIG page from the Hub
3. Notify the [Galaxy Community Board](https://galaxyproject.org/community/governance/gcb/), ideally via their chat channel

# Conclusion

Did you make a SIG? {% icon congratulations %} Congratulations! Being a part of a **SIG** is one of the best bits of working with Galaxy, so well done you for enabling that for like-minded scientists!

Or did you realise that you didn't need to make a **SIG**? {% icon congratulations %} Congratulations to you as well, for preventing the software smog of creating unneeded webpages.
