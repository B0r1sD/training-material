1. Go to a [timezone website](https://24timezones.com/difference/us-ca/brisbane#2024-06-30T00:00) to see equivalent times across the globe.
2. Select multiple times that capture at least 2/3 of the globe (we recommend three timezones)
3. Alternate meetings across those timezones to enable global participation.

*Time-saving tip*: If you meet every 2 months, you can set up 3 recurring calendar events for each time chosen to recur every 6 months. It's automatic, it's inclusive, and it's less effort!
