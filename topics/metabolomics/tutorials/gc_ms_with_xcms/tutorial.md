# Introduction

The study of metabolites in biological samples is routinely defined as metabolomics and provides the capability to investigate metabolism on a global and relatively unbiased scale in comparison to traditional targeted studies focused on specific pathways of metabolism and a small number of metabolites. The untargeted approach enables to detect thousands of metabolites in hypothesis-generating studies and to link previously unknown metabolites with biologically important roles. There are two major issues in contemporary metabolomics: the first is enormous loads of signal generated during the experiments, and the second is the fact that some metabolites in the studied samples may not be known to us. These obstacles make the task of processing and interpreting the metabolomics data a cumbersome and time-consuming process {% cite Nash2019 %}.

The list of alkanes with retention time and carbon number or retention index is used to compute the retention index of the deconvoluted peaks. The alkanes should be measured ideally in the same batch as the input sample collection. A reference spectral library (`.msp`) is used for identification of spectra. The spectral library contains the recorded and annotated mass spectra of compounds which can be detected in the sample and confirmed via comparison with this library. The specific library is the in-house library of metabolite standards. Sample metadata corresponds to a table containing information about our samples. In particular, it contains sample name, type (QC, blank, sample, etc.), batch number, and injection order.

## Convert data to mzML

Our input data are in `.raw` format, which is not suitable for the downstream tools in this tutorial. We can use tool {% tool [msconvert](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/galaxyp/msconvert/msconvert/3.0.20287.2) %} to convert them to the appropriate format (`.mzML` in this case).

## Create XCMS object

The first part of data processing is using XCMS tool. This step is only meant to read our `.mzML` files and generate an object usable by XCMS tool. {% tool [MSnbase readMSData](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/msnbase_readmsdata/msnbase_readmsdata/2.16.1+galaxy0) %} takes as input our files and prepares `RData` files for the first XCMS step.

# Peak detection using XCMS

The first step in the workflow is to detect the peaks in our data using XCMS. This part, however, is covered by a [separate tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics/metabolomics/tutorials/lcms-preprocessing/tutorial.html). Although the tutorial is dedicated to LC-MS data, it can be followed also for our GC data. Therefore, in this section, we do not explain this part of the workflow in detials, but rather refer the reader to the dedicated tutorial. Please also pay attention to the parameter values for individual Galaxy tools, as these can differ from the refered tutorial and are adjusted to our dataset.

## Peak picking

The first step is to extract peaks from each of your data files independently. For this purpose, we use _centWave_ chromatographic peak detection algorithm implemented in {% tool [xcms findChromPeaks (xcmsSet)](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/xcms_xcmsset/abims_xcms_xcmsSet/3.12.0+galaxy0) %}.

> <hands-on-title> Peak picking </hands-on-title>

>  {% tool [xcms findChromPeaks (xcmsSet)](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/xcms_xcmsset/abims_xcms_xcmsSet/3.12.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"RData file"*: `xsetRData` (output of **MSnbase readMSData** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Extraction method for peaks detection"*: `CentWave - chromatographic peak detection using the centWave method`
>        - *"Max tolerated ppm m/z deviation in consecutive scans in ppm"*: `3.0`
>        - *"Min,Max peak width in seconds"*: `1,15`
>        - In *"Advanced Options"*:
>            - *"Prefilter step for for the first analysis step (ROI detection)"*: `3,500`
>            - *"Noise filter"*: `1000`
>  
>    You can leave the other parameters with their default values.
>
{: .hands_on}

## Determining shared ions

At this step, you obtain a dataset collection containing one `RData` file per sample, with independent lists of ions. Next, we want to identify the ions shared between samples. To do so, first you need to group your individual `RData` files into a single one.

> <hands-on-title> Merging files </hands-on-title>
>
>  {% tool [xcms findChromPeaks Merger](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/xcms_merge/xcms_merge/3.12.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"RData file"*: `xsetRData` (output of **xcms findChromPeaks (xcmsSet)** {% icon tool %})
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Sample metadata file "*: `output` (Input dataset)
>
>    You can leave the other parameters with their default values.
>
{: .hands_on}

Now we can proceed with the grouping and determining shared ions among samples. The aim of this step, called _grouping_, is to obtain a single matrix of ionsâ€™ intensities for all samples.

> <hands-on-title> Grouping peaks </hands-on-title>
>
>  {% tool [xcms groupChromPeaks (group)](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/xcms_group/abims_xcms_group/3.12.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"RData file"*: `xsetRData` (output of **xcms findChromPeaks Merger** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Method to use for grouping"*: `PeakDensity - peak grouping based on time dimension peak densities`
>        - *"Bandwidth"*: `3.0`
>        - *"Minimum fraction of samples"*: `0.9`
>        - *"Width of overlapping m/z slices"*: `0.01`
>    - *"Get the Peak List"*: `Yes`
>
>    You can leave the other parameters with their default values.
>
{: .hands_on}

## Retention time correction

A deviation in retention time occurs from a sample to another, especially when you inject large sequences of samples. This steps aims at correcting retention time drift for each peak among samples.

> <hands-on-title> Retention time correction </hands-on-title>
>
>  {% tool [xcms adjustRtime (retcor)](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/xcms_retcor/abims_xcms_retcor/3.12.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"RData file"*: `xsetRData` (output of **xcms groupChromPeaks (group)** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Method to use for retention time correction"*: `PeakGroups - retention time correction based on aligment of features (peak groups) present in most/all samples.`
>        - *"Minimum required fraction of samples in which peaks for the peak group were identified"*: `0.7`
>        - *"Smooth method"*: `loess - non-linear alignment`
>
>    You can leave the other parameters with their default values.
>
{: .hands_on}

## Second round of determining shared ions

By applying retention time correction, the used retention time values were modified. Consequently, applying this step on your data requires to complete it with an additional _grouping_ step.

> <hands-on-title> Grouping peaks </hands-on-title>
>
>  {% tool [xcms groupChromPeaks (group)](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/lecorguille/xcms_group/abims_xcms_group/3.12.0+galaxy0) %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"RData file"*: `xsetRData` (output of **xcms adjustRtime (retcor)** {% icon tool %})
>    - *"Method to use for grouping"*: `PeakDensity - peak grouping based on time dimension peak densities`
>        - *"Bandwidth"*: `3.0`
>        - *"Minimum fraction of samples"*: `0.9`
>        - *"Width of overlapping m/z slices"*: `0.01`
>    - *"Get the Peak List"*: `Yes`
>        - *"Convert retention time (seconds) into minutes"*: `Yes`
>        - *"If NA values remain, replace them by 0 in the dataMatrix"*: `Yes`
>
>    You can leave the other parameters with their default values.
>
{: .hands_on}

## Integrating areas of missing peaks

At this point, the peak list may contain `NA` values when peaks were not considered peaks in only some of the samples in the first peak picking step. In this step, we will integrate signal in the mz-rt area of an ion (chromatographic peak group) for samples in which no chromatographic peak for this ion was identified.

# Peak deconvolution

The next step is deconvoluting the detected peaks in order to reconstruct the full spectra of the analysed compound. {% tool [RAMClustR](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/recetox/ramclustr/ramclustr/1.2.4+galaxy2) %} is used to group features based on correlations across samples in a hierarchy, focusing on consistency across samples. While a feature typically is derived from a single compound, a spectrum of mass signals is more a more-accurate representation of the mass spectrometric signal for a given metabolite. RAMClustR uses a novel grouping method that operates in an unsupervised manner to group signals from MS data into spectra without relying on predictability of the in-source phenomenon.

# Retention index calculation

We developed a new package {% tool [RIAssigner](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/recetox/riassigner/riassigner/0.3.2+galaxy1) %} to compute retention indices for files in the `.msp` format using an indexed reference list in `.csv` or `.msp` format.

The output follows the same format as the input, but with added retention index values. These will be used at a later stage to improve compound identification with an additional filtering step. Multiple computation methods (piecewise-linear & cubic spline) are supported.

# Identification

The deconvoluted spectra are annotated for identification by comparing them with a reference spectral library. This library contains spectra of standards measured on the same instrument for optimal comparability. The matchms package is used for spectral matching. The cosine score with a greedy peak pairing heuristic was used to compute the number of matching ions with a given tolerance and the cosine scores for the matched peaks.

> <details-title> Overview of the spectral similarity scores </details-title>
> > <h5>Cosine Greedy</h5>
> > The cosine score, also known as the dot product, is based on representing the similarity of two spectra through the cosine of an  angle between the vectors that the spectra produce. Two peaks are considered as matching if their *m/z* values lie within the given   tolerance. Cosine greedy looks up matching peaks in a "greedy" way, which does not always lead to the most optimal alignments.

> > <p>&nbsp;</p>
>
> > <h5>Cosine Hungarian</h5>
> > This method computes the similarities in the same way as the *Cosine Greedy* but with a difference in *m/z* peak alignment. The difference lies in that the Hungarian algorithm is used here to find matching peaks. This leads to the best peak pairs match, but can take significantly longer than the "greedy" algorithm.
> > <p>&nbsp;</p>
>
> > <h5>Modified Cosine</h5>
> > Modified Cosine is another, as its name states, representative of the family of cosine-based scores. This method aligns peaks by finding the best possible matches and consideres two peaks a match if their *m/z* values are within a tolerance before or after a mass-shift is applied. A mass shift is essentially a difference of precursor-*m/z* of two compared spectra. The similarity is then again expressed as a cosine of the angle between two vectors.
> > <p>&nbsp;</p>
>
> > <h5>Neutral Losses Cosine</h5>
> > Neutral Loss metric works similar to all described above with one major difference: instead of encoding the spectra as "intensity vs *m/z*" vector it encodes it to a "intensity vs *Î”m/z*", where delta is computed as an *m/z* difference between precursor and a fragment *m/z*. This in theory, could better capture the underlying structural similarities between molecules.

## Format the output

The output of the previous step is a `json` file. This format is very simple to read for our computers, but not so much for us. We can use {% tool [matchms output formatter](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/recetox/matchms_formatter/matchms_formatter/0.1.4) %} to convert the data to a tab-separated file with a scores matrix.

The output table contains the scores and number of matched ions of the deconvoluted spectra with the spectra in the reference library. The raw output is filtered to only contain the top matches (3 by default) and is then further filtered to contain only pairs with a score and number of matched ions larger than provided thresholds (0.65 & 3 by default).
