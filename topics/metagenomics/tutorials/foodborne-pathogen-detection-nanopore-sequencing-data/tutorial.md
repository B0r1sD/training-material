# Introduction

Food contaminations with pathogens are a major burden on our society. In the year 2019, foodborne pathogens caused 137 diseases in Germany (BVL 2019). Globally, they affect an estimated 600 million people a year and impact socioeconomic development at different levels. These outbreaks are mainly due to Salmonella spp. followed by Campylobacter spp. and Noroviruses.

During the investigation of a foodborne outbreak, a microbiological analysis of the probable responsible food vehicle is performed in order to detect the responsible pathogens and track the contamination source. By default, to detect bacterial pathogens in food, the European Regulation (CE) follows ISO standards, but alternative methods with equivalent performance are possible. Usually, foodborne pathogens are detected and identified by stepwise cultures on selective media and/or targeting specific genes with real-time PCRs. To characterise the detected strains, the current gold standard is Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) or Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). These techniques have some disadvantages. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has been proposed as an alternative: detection of all genes with just one sequencing run, phylogenetic analysis to link cases, information on antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence, serotype, resistance to sanitizers, root cause, and other critical factors in one assay, including historical reference to pathogen emergence. WGS is more than a surveillance tool and was recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for surveillance and outbreak investigation. WGS still requires isolation of the targeted pathogen, which is a time-consuming, not always straightforward nor successful process. Sequencing methods without prior isolation could solve this issue.

The evolution of sequencing techniques in the last decades has made possible the development of shotgun metagenomic sequencing, i.e. the direct sequencing of all DNA present in a sample. This approach gives an overview of the genomic composition of all cells in the sample, including the food source itself, the microbial community and any possible pathogens and their complete genetic information, without the need for prior isolation. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterise pathogens and their functional characteristics (e.g. virulence genes) in naturally contaminated or spiked food samples. 

The currently available studies used Illumina sequencing, generating short reads. Longer read lengths, generated by third generation sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford [Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) Technologies (ONT), make it easier and more practical to identify strains with fewer reads. MinION (from Oxford Nanopore) is a portable, real-time device for ONT sequencing. Several proof-of-principle studies have shown the utility of ONT long read sequencing from metagenomic samples for pathogen identification. 

The industry partner of this project, Biolytix, is a Swiss Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME)  founded in 1998, that specializes in molecular biology and microbiological analyses. They developed a procedure to extract, sequence using MinION (ONT) sequencing and analyse a food sample for foodborne pathogen detection and contamination source tracking. However, the bioinformatics pipelines are not following the best practices for open data science, not straightforward and can only be manipulated by the original author, making it not scalable. Therefore, the aim of the Galaxy workflows (step by step) presented in this tutorial is to modernise, FAIRify and validate the bioinformatic pipeline using modern paradigms of data science to make it accessible and scalable.

In this tutorial we will be presenting a Galaxy workflow it’s main goal is to agnostically detect and track pathogens in foods’ (chicken, cow, etc.) nanopore samples datasets and identifying contaminations, by identifying which samples are contaminated with a pathogen, what exactly is this pathogen and what is the degree of its severity (Virulence Factor).

# Dataset

In this tutorial, the datasets are all generated by Biolytix. They are all chicken spiked with Salmonella's different stains. The two barcodes we are using are; Barcode 10 Spike 2, which is chicken spiked with Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica this dataset was generated on the 14th of July 2022, and Barcode 11 Spike 2b, which is chicken spiked with Salmonella enterica subsp. Houtenae generated on 20th of July 2022.

<div class="ShortVersion" markdown="1">

As you chose to follow the short version of the tutorial we will be running the complete sub-workflows each for complete task starting from the pre-processing of the sequenced datasets till the pathogen tracking among all our chosen samples. In order to check the step by step tools used for every sub-workflow please follow the tutorial LongVersion.

# Pre-Processing

Before starting any analysis, it is always a good idea to assess the quality of your input data and improve it where possible by trimming and filtering reads.

In this section we will run a workflow that performs the following tasks:
1. Assess read quality before and after trimming using **FastQC** {% icon tool %}, **Nanoplot** {% icon tool %} and  **MultiQC** {% icon tool %}
2. Filter reads by length and quality, quality improving using **Porechop** {% icon tool %} and **Fastp** {% icon tool %}
3. Remove all possible host contamination sequences e.g. Chicken, Cow, etc **Kraken2** {% icon tool %} with Kalamri database, **Filter Tabular** {% icon tool %} and **Filter Sequence By ID** {% icon tool %}

We will run all these steps using a single workflow, then discuss each step and the results in more detail. Please do the same steps for both histories; Barcode 10 and Barcode 11.

> <hands-on-title>Pretreatments</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. **Import the workflow** into Galaxy
>    - Copy the URL (e.g. via right-click) of [this workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.dir }}workflows/nanopore_preprocessing.ga) or download it to your computer.
>    - Import the workflow into Galaxy
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_import.md %}

> 2. Run **Workflow 1:  Nanopore Datasets - Pre-Processing** {% icon workflow %} using the following parameters:
>    - *"Send results to a new history"*: `No`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"1: Nanopore reads of a sample"*: `Barcode 10`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"2: Host to Remove Specifier"*: `^.*Gallus|Homo|Bos.*$`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"5: Porechop Output format for the reads"*: `fastq.qz`
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run.md %}

{: .hands_on}

The workflow will take a little while to complete. Once tools have completed, the results will be available in your history for viewing. Note that only the most important outputs will he visible; intermediate files are hidden by default.

While you wait for the workflow to complete, please run the same workflow for the second history with Barcode 11 and continue reading in the next section(s) we will go into a bit more detail about what happens in each step of this workflow and examine the results.

## Quality Control

During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis and can lead to a misinterpretation of the data.

Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis.
In this tutorial we use similar tools as described in the tutorial ["Quality control"]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}):
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) generates a web report that will aid you in assessing the quality of your data
- [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) plotting tool for long read sequencing data and alignments
- [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) combines multiple FastQC reports into a single overview report, in this tutorial to check the quality of the sequencing before and after trimming and quality improvement
- [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) and [Fastp](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i884/5093234) for trimming and filtering

For more information about how to interpret the plots generated by FastQC and MultiQC, please see our dedicated Quality Control Tutorial.

> > 3. After checking what is wrong, e.g. before trimming, we should think about the errors reported by FastQC: they may come from the type of sequencing or what we sequenced (check the ["Quality control" training]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) for more details). However, despite these challenges, we can already see sequences getting slightly better after the trimming, so we can proceed with our analyses.

## Hosts Filtering
Generally, we are not intersted in the food (host) sequences that may or may not include the pathogen, rather we are intersted only in the pathogen itself. Thats why it's an important step to get rid of all hosts' sequences so we are only remained with sequences that might include a pathogen to start our analyses on. To use these workflows in real life you just run them on samples collected from, for example, a food factory at different time points and locations in the production process in order to spot when and where the pathogen entered the food and affect it. The workflow will filter out all possible hosts, e.g. meat, milk, etc then remove all found hosts out, and keep the remaining sequences to test and track pathogens for. In this tutorial, we know in prior that the samples we have are chicken spiked with salmonella so we already know what will we get. 

In this tutorial we use the following tools and database to remove all hosts' sequences:
- [Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) a taxonomic classification system, uses build in and external libraries to classify the sequences into known taxon up to spieces level
- [Kalamari](https://github.com/lskatz/Kalamari) A database of completed assemblies for metagenomics-related tasks
- [Filter Tabular](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=48120541c8d5534d&changeset_revision=34d29339abab) Provides tools for manipulation of tablular files, used to filter all hosts out
- [Filter sequences by ID](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id) By default it divides a FASTA, FASTQ or Standard Flowgram Format (SFF) file in two, those sequences with or without an ID present in the tabular file column(s) specified. You can opt to have a single output file of just the matching records, or just the non-matching ones.

# Taxonomy Profiling
In this sub-workflow we will learn about the different taxonomy levels in our samples starting from the kingdom level up to the spieces level and visualize that. It's important in our testcase to check what might be the spieces of a possible pathogen to be found, it gets us closer to the investigation as well as discovering possible multiple food infections if any exsisted.

If you have not yet noticed, in the previous sub-workflow we ran **Kraken2** along with **Kalamari** database, which is also a kind of taxonomy profiling but the database used is designed to include all possible hosts' sequences that we need to filter them out. In this sub-workflow, we will run **Kraken2** again but this time with one of its built-in databases **Standard PlusPF**, which can give us more insight of possible spieces that can be pathogenic candidates than **Kalamari**, you can test this yourself by comparing reports of both **Kraken2** runs.

In this section we will run a sub-workflow that performs the following tasks:
1. Taxonomy profiling using **Kraken2** {% icon tool %} with **Standard PlusPF** database
2. Generate a kraken-biom report needed for the interactive visualization using **Kraken-biom** {% icon tool %}
3. Taxonomy visualization with one of the interactive tools in Galaxy, **Phinch Visualisation** {% icon tool %}, prefereably to use on Chrome

We will run all these steps using a single workflow, then discuss each step and the results in more detail. Please do the same steps for both histories; Barcode 10 and Barcode 11.

## Visualization
In order to view the taxonomy profiling produced by **Kraken2** there are alot of tools to be used afterwards such as **Krona pie chart** {% icon tool %}, however the spieces classified are a lot to be shown by this tool. For that reason, we have chosen the [Phinch visualization](https://www.phinch.org/){% icon tool %} interactive tool as it contamins multiple visulaization plots, it's interactive you can choose between different parameters, you can visualize each taxonomic level on its own, you can have your metadate of the samples represented along with the taxonomic visulaization, download all plots for publications and a lot of other benfits.

**Phinch visualization** {% icon tool %} needs a Biom file format as an input for that we needed the [Kraken-Biom](https://github.com/smdabdoub/kraken-biom) tool {% icon tool %} to convert the **Kraken2** tabular output into a Biom file. 

Now lets try the **Phinch visulization** {% icon tool %} running for barcode 11 sample history

# Gene based pathogenic identification
In this sub-workflow we will analyse the sequences in our samples and identify genes that have a [virulence factor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/virulence-factor), which will then define a pathogen and its severity level. We will also identify [antimicrobial resistance genes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/antibiotic-resistance-genes), which their presence will destroy the antibiotic and do not alter the target site and spread throughput the pathogenic bacteria decreasing the overall fitness of the host. Using [MLST](https://pubmlst.org/) database we will also determain with strain of the bacteria we are testing for pathogenitiy. Never the less, will be creating our Fasta and Tabular files that we will use to track and visualize our pathogenic identification thoughout all samples needed for the **Pathogen Tracking among all samples** sub-workflow

In this section we will run a sub-workflow that performs the following tasks:
1. Taxonomy profiling using **Kraken2** {% icon tool %} with **Standard PlusPF** database
2. Generate a kraken-biom report needed for the interactive visualization using **Kraken-biom** {% icon tool %}
3. Taxonomy visualization with one of the interactive tools in Galaxy, **Phinch Visualisation** {% icon tool %}, prefereably to use on Chrome

We will run all these steps using a single workflow, then discuss each step and the results in more detail. Please do the same steps for both histories; Barcode 10 and Barcode 11.
