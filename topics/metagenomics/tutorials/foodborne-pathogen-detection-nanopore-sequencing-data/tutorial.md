# Introduction

Food contamination with pathogens are a major burden on our society. In the year 2019, foodborne pathogens caused 137 diseases in Germany (BVL 2019). Globally, they affect an estimated 600 million people a year and impact socioeconomic development at different levels. These outbreaks are mainly due to Salmonella spp. followed by Campylobacter spp. and Noroviruses.

During the investigation of a foodborne outbreak, a microbiological analysis of the probable responsible food vehicle is performed in order to detect the responsible pathogens and track the contamination source. By default, to detect bacterial pathogens in food, the European Regulation (CE) follows ISO standards, but alternative methods with equivalent performance are possible. Usually, foodborne pathogens are detected and identified by stepwise cultures on selective media and/or targeting specific genes with real-time PCRs. To characterise the detected strains, the current gold standard is Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) or Multiple-Locus Variable Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). These techniques have some disadvantages. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has been proposed as an alternative: detection of all genes with just one sequencing run, phylogenetic analysis to link cases, information on antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence, serotype, resistance to sanitizers, root cause, and other critical factors in one assay, including historical reference to pathogen emergence. WGS is more than a surveillance tool and was recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for surveillance and outbreak investigation. WGS still requires isolation of the targeted pathogen, which is a time-consuming, not always straightforward nor successful process. Sequencing methods without prior isolation could solve this issue.

The evolution of sequencing techniques in the last decades has made possible the development of shotgun metagenomic sequencing, i.e. the direct sequencing of all DNA present in a sample. This approach gives an overview of the genomic composition of all cells in the sample, including the food source itself, the microbial community and any possible pathogens and their complete genetic information, without the need for prior isolation. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of shotgun metagenomics to identify and characterise pathogens and their functional characteristics (e.g. virulence genes) in naturally contaminated or spiked food samples. 

The currently available studies used Illumina sequencing, generating short reads. Longer read lengths, generated by third generation sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford [Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) Technologies (ONT), make it easier and more practical to identify strains with fewer reads. MinION (from Oxford Nanopore) is a portable, real-time device for ONT sequencing. Several proof-of-principle studies have shown the utility of ONT long read sequencing from metagenomic samples for pathogen identification. 

{% snippet faqs/galaxy/sequencing_nanopore.md %}

The industry partner of the datasets used in this tutorial, Biolytix, is a Swiss Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME)  founded in 1998, that specializes in molecular biology and microbiological analyses. They developed a procedure to extract, sequence using MinION (ONT) sequencing and analyze a food sample for foodborne pathogen detection and contamination source tracking. However, the bioinformatics pipelines are not following the best practices for open data science, not straightforward and can only be manipulated by the original author, making it not scalable. Therefore, the aim of the Galaxy workflows (step by step) presented in this tutorial is to modernise, FAIRify and validate the bioinformatic pipeline using modern paradigms of data science to make it accessible and scalable.

In this tutorial we will be presenting a Galaxy workflow it’s main goal is to agnostically detect and track pathogens in foods’ (chicken, cow, etc.) nanopore samples datasets and identifying contaminations, by identifying which samples are contaminated with a pathogen, what exactly is this pathogen and what is the degree of its severity (Virulence Factor).

# Dataset

In this tutorial, the datasets are all generated by Biolytix. They are all chicken spiked with Salmonella's different stains. The two barcodes we are using are; Barcode 10 Spike 2, which is chicken spiked with Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica this dataset was generated on the 14th of July 2022, and Barcode 11 Spike 2b, which is chicken spiked with Salmonella enterica subsp. Houtenae generated on 20th of July 2022.

# Choose your own tutorial
{% include _includes/cyoa-choices.html option1="ShortVersion" option2="LongVersion" default="ShortVersion" %}

<div class="ShortVersion" markdown="1">

As you chose to follow the short version of the tutorial we will be running the complete sub-workflows each for complete task starting from the pre-processing of the sequenced datasets till the pathogen tracking among all our chosen samples. In order to check the step by step tools used for every sub-workflow please follow the tutorial's LongVersion.

# Pre-Processing

Before starting any analysis, it is always a good idea to assess the quality of your input data and improve it where possible by trimming and filtering reads.

In this section we will run a workflow that performs the following tasks:
1. Assess read quality before and after trimming using **FastQC** {% icon tool %}, **Nanoplot** {% icon tool %} and  **MultiQC** {% icon tool %}
2. Filter reads by length and quality, quality improving using **Porechop** {% icon tool %} and **Fastp** {% icon tool %}
3. Remove all possible host contamination sequences e.g. Chicken, Cow, etc **Kraken2** {% icon tool %} with Kalamari database, **Filter Tabular** {% icon tool %} and **Filter Sequence By ID** {% icon tool %}

We will run all these steps using a single sub-workflow, then discuss each step and the results in more detail. Please do the same steps for both histories; Barcode 10 and Barcode 11.

> <hands-on-title>Pretreatments</hands-on-title>

> 1. **Import the workflow** into Galaxy
>    - Copy the URL (e.g. via right-click) of [this workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.dir }}workflows/nanopore_preprocessing.ga) or download it to your computer.
>    - Import the workflow into Galaxy

{: .hands_on}

The workflow will take a little while to complete. Once tools have completed, the results will be available in your history for viewing. Note that only the most important outputs will he visible; intermediate files are hidden by default.

While you wait for the workflow to complete, please run the same workflow for the second history with Barcode 11 and continue reading in the next section(s) we will go into a bit more detail about what happens in each step of this workflow and examine the results.

## Quality Control

During sequencing, errors are introduced, such as incorrect nucleotides being called. These are due to the technical limitations of each sequencing platform. Sequencing errors might bias the analysis and can lead to a misinterpretation of the data.

Sequence quality control is therefore an essential first step in your analysis.
In this tutorial we use similar tools as described in the tutorial ["Quality control"]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}):
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) generates a web report that will aid you in assessing the quality of your data
- [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) plotting tool for long read sequencing data and alignments
- [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) combines multiple FastQC reports into a single overview report, in this tutorial to check the quality of the sequencing before and after trimming and quality improvement
- [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) and [Fastp](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i884/5093234) for trimming and filtering

For more information about how to interpret the plots generated by FastQC and MultiQC, please see our dedicated Quality Control Tutorial.

After checking what is wrong, e.g. before trimming, we should think about the errors reported by FastQC: they may come from the type of sequencing or what we sequenced (check the ["Quality control" training]({% link topics/sequence-analysis/tutorials/quality-control/tutorial.md %}): [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) for more details). However, despite these challenges, we can already see sequences getting slightly better after the trimming, so we can proceed with our analyses.

## Hosts Filtering
Generally, we are not interested in the food (host) sequences that may or may not include the pathogen, rather we are interested only in the pathogen itself. That's why it's an important step to get rid of all hosts' sequences so we are only remained with sequences that might include a pathogen to start our analyses on. To use these workflows in real life you just run them on samples collected from, for example, a food factory at different time points and locations in the production process in order to spot when and where the pathogen entered the food and affect it. The workflow will filter out all possible hosts, e.g. meat, milk, etc then remove all found hosts out, and keep the remaining sequences to test and track pathogens for. In this tutorial, we know in prior that the samples we have are chicken spiked with salmonella so we already know what will we get. 

In this tutorial we use the following tools and database to remove all hosts' sequences:
- [Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) a taxonomic classification system, uses build in and external libraries to classify the sequences into known taxon up to species level
- [Kalamari](https://github.com/lskatz/Kalamari) A database of completed assemblies for metagenomics-related tasks
- [Filter Tabular](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=48120541c8d5534d&changeset_revision=34d29339abab) Provides tools for manipulation of tabular files, used to filter all hosts out
- [Filter sequences by ID](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_filter_by_id) By default it divides a FASTA, FASTQ or Standard Flowgram Format (SFF) file in two, those sequences with or without an ID present in the tabular file column(s) specified. You can opt to have a single output file of just the matching records, or just the non-matching ones.

# Taxonomy Profiling
In this sub-workflow we will learn about the different taxonomy levels in our samples starting from the kingdom level up to the species level and visualize that. It's important in our testcase to check what might be the species of a possible pathogen to be found, it gets us closer to the investigation as well as discovering possible multiple food infections if any existed.

{% snippet topics/metagenomics/faqs/taxon.md %}

If you have not yet noticed, in the previous sub-workflow we ran **Kraken2** along with **Kalamari** database, which is also a kind of taxonomy profiling but the database used is designed to include all possible hosts' sequences that we need to filter them out. In this sub-workflow, we will run **Kraken2** again but this time with one of its built-in databases **Standard PlusPF**, which can give us more insight of possible species that can be pathogenic candidates than **Kalamari**, you can test this yourself by comparing reports of both **Kraken2** runs.

In this section we will run a sub-workflow that performs the following tasks:
1. Taxonomy profiling using **Kraken2** {% icon tool %} with **Standard PlusPF** database
2. Generate a kraken-biom report needed for the interactive visualization using **Kraken-biom** {% icon tool %}
3. Taxonomy visualization with one of the interactive tools in Galaxy, **Phinch Visualisation** {% icon tool %}, preferably to use on Chrome

> <details-title>Kraken2 and the k-mer approach for taxonomy classification</details-title>
>
> In the $$k$$-mer approach for taxonomy classification, we use a database containing DNA sequences of genomes whose taxonomy we already know. On a computer, the genome sequences are broken into short pieces of length $$k$$ (called $$k$$-mers), usually 30bp.
>
> **Kraken** examines the $$k$$-mers within the query sequence, searches for them in the database, looks for where these are placed within the taxonomy tree inside the database, makes the classification with the most probable position, then maps $$k$$-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain the given $$k$$-mer.
>
> ![Kraken2](../../images/metagenomics-nanopore/kmers-kraken.jpg "Kraken sequence classification algorithm. To classify a sequence, each k-mer in the sequence is mapped to the lowest common ancestor (LCA, i.e. the lowest node) of the genomes that contain that k-mer in the database. The taxa associated with the sequence's k-mers, as well as the taxa's ancestors, form a pruned subtree of the general taxonomy tree, which is used for classification. In the classification tree, each node has a weight equal to the number of k-mers in the sequence associated with the node's taxon. Each root-to-leaf (RTL) path in the classification tree is scored by adding all weights in the path, and the maximal RTL path in the classification tree is the classification path (nodes highlighted in yellow). The leaf of this classification path (the orange, leftmost leaf in the classification tree) is the classification used for the query sequence. Source: {% cite Wood2014 %}")

## Visualization
In order to view the taxonomy profiling produced by **Kraken2** there are a lot of tools to be used afterwards such as **Krona pie chart** {% icon tool %}, however the species classified are a lot to be shown by this tool. For that reason, we have chosen the [Phinch visualization](https://www.phinch.org/){% icon tool %} interactive tool as it contains multiple visualization plots, it's interactive you can choose between different parameters, you can visualize each taxonomic level on its own, you can have your metadata of the samples represented along with the taxonomic visualization, download all plots for publications and a lot of other benefits.

**Phinch visualization** {% icon tool %} needs a Biom file format as an input for that we needed the [Kraken-Biom](https://github.com/smdabdoub/kraken-biom) tool {% icon tool %} to convert the **Kraken2** tabular output into a Biom file. 

Now lets try the **Phinch visulization** {% icon tool %} running for Barcode 11 sample history

# Gene based pathogenic identification
In this sub-workflow we will analyze the sequences in our samples and identify genes that have a [Virulence Factor (VF)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/virulence-factor), which will then define a pathogen and its severity level. We will also identify [Antimicrobial Resistance genes (AMR)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/antibiotic-resistance-genes), which their presence will destroy the antibiotic that will lead to not altering the target site and spread throughput the pathogenic bacteria decreasing the overall fitness of the host. Using [Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST)](https://pubmlst.org/) database we will also determine the strain of the bacteria we are testing for pathogenicity. Never the less, we will be creating our Fasta and Tabular files that we will use to track and visualize our pathogenic identification throughout all samples, which is done in the **Pathogen Tracking among all samples** sub-workflow coming later in this tutorial.

In this section we will run a sub-workflow that performs the following tasks:
1. Genome assembly or creating contigs from our sequences using **metaFlye** {% icon tool %} then assembly polishing using **medaka consensus pipeline** {% icon tool %} and visualizing the assembly graph using **Bandage Image** {% icon tool %}
2. Generate an **MLST** report with **MLST** {% icon tool %} that scans genomes against PubMLST schemes
3. Generate reports with **AMR** genes and genes with **VF** using **ABRicate** {% icon tool %}
4. Manipulate tabular reports to prepare them for **Pathogen Tracking among all samples** sub-workflow using tools such as **Cut**{% icon tool %}, **Replace**{% icon tool %}, **Add line to file**{% icon tool %}, **Compose text parameter value**{% icon tool %}, **Tabular-to-FASTA**{% icon tool %} and **Concatenate datasets**{% icon tool %}

We will run all these steps using a single sub-workflow, then discuss each step and the results in more detail. Please do the same steps for both histories; Barcode 10 and Barcode 11.

But before we run the sub-workflow we need to upload one more file needed to create a report for this sub-workflow **MLST** analysis.

## Assembly
After improving the quality of the sequences in our samples and removing all the hosts' sequences, the next step is to analysis them and search for pathogens. To do so, we have to first assemble our reads and create our contigs file, which will then be used to search databases with.

Recent advances in the challenging area of metagenomic bacterial genome assembly in the form of the specialized long-read metagenomic assembly program [metaflye](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00971-x) and sequence polishing tools such as [medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka) have made the inclusion of these analyses relatively simple. Metaflye and medaka facilitate the rapid assembly and correction of the long, error-prone nanopore reads obtained from the metagenomic sequencing in multiple earlier work.

For visualizing the assembly graph output from **Flye**{% icon tool %} we have chosen [Bandage Image](https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/){% icon tool %}.

## MLST Database
**MLST** {% icon tool %} is used to scan the [MLST](https://pubmlst.org/) database against PubMLST typing schemes. It's one of the analysis that you can perform on your dataset to determine the allele IDs you can also detect novel alleles. For the further analysis of this tutorial, this step is not important to identify pathogens and track them, however we wanted to show some of the analysis that one can use Galaxy in and understand more about the dataset as well as identifying the strain that might be a pathogen or not. 

The output file of the **MLST** {% icon tool %} is a tab-separated output file which contains: - the filename - the closest PubMLST scheme name - the ST (sequence type) - the allele IDs.

## Antimicrobial Resistance Genes
Now, we want to search our samples' contigs for **AMR** genes for that we run **ABRicate** {% icon tool %} and chose the **NCBI Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Gene Database** from the advanced options of the tool.

The tool will identify if there is an AMR found or not, in which contig, in which location on the contig, what is the name of the exact product, what does it resist against and a lot of other information regarding the found **AMR**

## Virulence Factor Database
In this step we return back to the main goal of the tutorial where we want to identify the pathogens, where we want to identify if the found bacteria in our samples is a bacteria pathogen or not. One of the ways to do that is to identify if the sequences include genes with a [Virulence Facor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646308/) or not, such that if the samples include genes with a Virulence Factor then its for sure a pathogen.
> <details-title>Bacteria Pathogen</details-title>

> A bacterial pathogen is usually defined as any bacterium that has the capacity to cause disease. Its ability to cause disease is called pathogenicity.

> <details-title>Virulence Factors</details-title>
>
> Virulence factors refer to the properties (i.e., gene products) that enable a microorganism to establish itself on or within a host of a particular species and enhance its potential to cause disease. Virulence factors include bacterial toxins, cell surface proteins that mediate bacterial attachment, cell surface carbohydrates and proteins that protect a bacterium, and hydrolytic enzymes that may contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium.

# SNP based pathogenic identification
In this section, we will run a sub-workflow that can run in parallel to **Taxonomy Profiling**, **Gene based pathogenic identification** and **Pathogen Tracking among all samples** sub-workflows, so feel free to run it in the time you are waiting for the other sub-workflows to finish running.

# Pathogen Tracking among all samples
In this section of the tutorial we will be grouping some outputs of all the samples together in one history, in order to track our identified pathogens, in the **Gene based pathogenic identification** sub-workflow, through out the samples. So the sub-workflow of this section can run directly after the **Gene based pathogenic identification** sub-workflow runs have been finished for all the tested samples. 

In this part of the tutorial we will draw a [heatmap](https://www.cd-genomics.com/microbioseq/introduction-to-heatmap-a-visualized-tool-for-microbial-community-composition-analysis.html) of the identified genes with a **VF**, which indicates a pathogen, and visualize in which samples these genes can be found. We will also draw a [phylogenetic tree](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/phylogenetic-tree) for each pathogenic gene detected, where we will relate the contigs of the samples together where this gene is found. By these two types of visualizations we can have an overview with all samples together and each gene on its own, how each samples are related to one another and which common pathogenic genes they share. Given the time of the sampling and the location one can easy identify using these graphes where and when the contamination has occurred among the different samples.

To achieve that we first need to copy some of the output datasets from **Gene based pathogenic identification** sub-workflow running for both Barcode 10 history and Barcode 11 history.

> <hands-on-title>Copy datasets from our two histories to a new history</hands-on-title>
>
> 1. Create a new history for for this part of the tutorial where we will create collections from the results of the two samples' histories we had that are needed to track and visualize our found pathogens.
> 2. Copy the following datasets from Barcode 10 history to the new created history, then copy the same files from Barcode 11 history too.
>     
>     a. VFDB Accession
>     b. VFDB Accession Tabular with SampleID as a header
>     c. VFs ABRicate Sample Specific Formatted Tabular
>     d. Sample Specific Contigs FASTA file
>     
> 3. Now let's create collections of the copied datasets in the new history
>    - In the new created history each two similar datasets are grouped in a collection. In a different example if you tested more samples so this collection will include all the same named files of all the testes different samples 
>    - We will group both `VFDB Accession` files into a collection and name it `VFDB Accession Column`
>    - We will group both `VFDB Accession Tabular with SampleID as a header` files into a collection and name `List of All Samples VFDB Accession Column with Sample ID Tabulars`
>    - We will group both `VFs ABRicate Sample Specific Formatted Tabular` files into a collection and name it `All Samples ABRicate Tabulars`
>    - We will group both `Sample Specific Contigs FASTA file` files into a collection and name it `All Samples Contigs Fasta files`

Now after preparing our inputs to the sub-workflow let's run it.

> <hands-on-title>All Samples Analysis</hands-on-title>

>    - Import the workflow into Galaxy
>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_import.md %}
>
> 2. Run **Workflow 5: Nanopore Datasets - Reports of All Samples along with Full genomes and VF genes Phylogenetic trees** {% icon workflow %} using the following parameters:
>    - *"Send results to a new history"*: `No`
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"All Samples Contigs Fasta files"*: `All Samples Contigs Fasta files` the collection you have just created
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"All Samples ABRicate Tabulars"*: `All Samples ABRicate Tabulars` the collection you have just created
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"List of All Samples VFDB Accession Column with Sample ID Tabulars"*: `List of All Samples VFDB Accession Column with Sample ID Tabulars` the collection you have just created

>
>    {% snippet faqs/galaxy/workflows_run.md %}

{: .hands_on}

In this sub-workflow we run the following tools:
1. For heatmap **Heatmap w ggplot** {% icon tool %} is used along with other tabular manipulating tools, such as **Advanced Cut** {% icon tool %}, **Paste** {% icon tool %}, **Transpose** {% icon tool %}, **Replace** {% icon tool %}, **Multi-Join** {% icon tool %} and **Add line to file** {% icon tool %}. All these tools are used to adjust the two of the input tabular files we copied to out history which are `VFs ABRicate Sample Specific Formatted Tabular` and `Sample Specific Contigs FASTA file` from both samples.

2. For the phylogenetic trees, for each bacteria pathogen gene found in the samples we use **ClustalW** {% icon tool %} for [Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/multiple-sequence-alignment) needed before constructing a phylogenetic tree, for the tree itself we use **FASTTREE** {% icon tool %} and **Newick Display** {% icon tool %} to visualize it. Also other table manipulation tools to adjust the other two input files to draw the trees such as, **Cut** {% icon tool %}, **Split by group** {% icon tool %}, **Filter sequence by ID** {% icon tool %}, **Remove beginning** {% icon tool %} and **bedtools getfasta** {% icon tool %}.

## Heatmap
A heatmap is one of the visualization techniques that can give you a complete overview of all the samples together and whether or not a certain value exists. In this tutorial, we use the heatmap to visualize all samples aside and check which common bacteria pathogen genes are found in samples and which is only found in one of them. 

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> Now let's see how your heatmap looks like, you can zoom-in and out in your Galaxy history.

> >    ![Heatmap](../../images/heatmap.png)
>
> 1. Mention three of the common bacteria pathogen genes found in both samples
> 2. Mention one that is only found in Barcode 10 and one that is only found in Barcode 11
> 3. How can the differences in the found VF bacteria pathogen genes between the two samples be interpreted?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > 1. Three of the bacteria pathogen genes with a **VF** identified by the **VFDB** that are common in both samples are with the following accession number: **NP_461810**, **NP_461809** and **NP_459541**
> > 2. **AAF98391** is only found in Barcode 10 sample and **NP_460360** is only found in Barcode 11 sample
> > 3. Both samples are spiked with the same species of the pathogen; Salmonella enterica, but not the same strain. Barcode 10 sample is spiked with Enterica strain and Barcode 11 with Houtenae strain. This can be the main cause of the most similarities and the few difference found bacteria pathogen genes between both of the samples. Other factors such as the time and location of the sampling may cause other differences. By knowing the metadata of the samples inputted for the sub-workflows in real life we can understand what actually happened. We can have samples with no pathogen found then we start detecting genes from the 7th or 8th sample, then we can identify where and when the pathogen entered the host, and stop the cause of that

## Phylogenetic Trees
Phylogenetic trees are nice ways to track all the bacteria pathogen genes one by one in all samples. So we will have a tree for every found gene, this tree will indicate which contigs the gene is found in all samples and relating these contigs together based on their topology. With such trees we can identify on which location of the sequences sample genome the pathogentic gene is found and is it the same or different location as the other samples. We can also see how many samples have these genes in common and accordingly track our contaminations.
