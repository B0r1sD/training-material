# What are "Muons"?

Muons are electrically charged elementary particles
- with 207x the mass of an electron

# What is Muon Spectroscopy?

Spin polarised, positively charged muons are channelled into beamlines and collide with material samples.

They are implanted into the sample and decay with an average lifetime of 2.2Î¼s, releasing a positron (positive electron).

The positrons leave the sample and are collected by a positron detector. These detections are used to infer the behaviour of the muons within the sample.

# Muon Simulations

Main problem in Muon Spectroscopy - where is the implanted muon (known as the stopping site)?

The stopping site is influenced by many factors

But we can use simulations to approximate its location

# Muon Galaxy tools

Muon Galaxy provides a range of tools for simulating Muon science experiments including:
  - approximating the stopping site
  - simulating spin dynamics of muonated structures
