Sometimes we want to share our workflows outside of Galaxy, like printing it on a poster.
Making screenshots of Workflows looses a lot of detail, often to an degree where information is lost.
There are third party tools which can help us in making high resolution screenshots that preserve all details
and produce pictures which are suitable for printing and sharing.
