# About DataPLANT

![DataPLANT: participate in a thriving PLANT data research community, document and publish your research data FAIR, ensure the reproducibility of your research](images/dataplant-infographic.png)

Towards democratization of plant research.

???
- Dataplant is a consortium from the heart of the German plant research community.
- It aims to establish sustainable Research Data management, RDM, by providing both digital assistance such as software or teaching material.
- as well as and personal assistance, for example via on-site consultation or workshops.
- Dataplant is committed to developing an RDM system that meets community requirements and facilitates the processing and contextualization of research datasets in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

# Annotated Research Context (ARC)

![concept of an ARC, experimental data, computation and annotation bundled together](images/arc-intro.png)

Your entire investigation in a single unified bag

???
- Annotated research contexts, or arcs for short, provide a way to bundle your entire investigation in one unified place
- Arcs can contain your experimental data and annotation, as well as your computational results and workflows
- Arcs allow you to share your research in a fair and open way
