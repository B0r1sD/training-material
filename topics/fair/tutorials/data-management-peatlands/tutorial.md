# Introduction

Peatland monitoring and research generates data that is used for management, conservation and policy related to these ecosystems. To ensure that your project data is collected systematically and can be analysed, shared, and re-used it is important to have a data management plan.

This tutorial is a short introduction to writing a Data Management Plan (DMP) with examples for peatland monitoring projects and initiatives.

You can find more information on DMPs in the Research Data Management Toolkit for Life Sciences ( https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)

# What is a Data Management Plan?

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a live document that provides a framework for managing data material during and after the research project.
A data management plan will facilitate the process of collecting and managing your peatland data and will allow you to discuss with your team how to share data, considering the requirements of your organisation and funders.

# Key components of a DMP
DMP templates vary by institution and funding agencies. Vasilis (cite Vasilis) has identified the common components of DMPs  from UKRI life-science councils (MRC, BBSRC and NERC).

# FAIR data management solutions

After you have filled in the DMP template, review how you can make your DMP FAIR.
There are several ways to set up FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management plans (DMPs) 

Findable (F): Data description and collection or reuse of existing data.  Using metadata and community recognised standards for curation that enable someone to find the data.
Accessible (A): Standardised authentication or authorisation (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS) for open and restricted data access.
 Interoperable (I): Documentation and data quality, and community standards for data exchange (e.g. tab-delimited text).
Reusable (R): Storage and backup supported by legal and ethical requirements, as well as data release policies.
