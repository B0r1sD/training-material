# Metadata guidelines for bioimaging data

REMBI (Recommended Metadata for Biological Images) was proposed as a draft metadata guidelines to begin addressing the needs of diverse communities within light and electron microscopy. Currently, these guidelines are in draft form to encourage discussion within the community, but they provide a useful guide as to what metadata should be gathered to make your image data FAIR. They divide the metadata requirements into eight submodules, which breaks up what can seem to be a daunting task!
