# Workflow context


The workflow used as an example here goes from :
- First produce a protein fasta file from a nucleotide fasta file using Prodigal (it is a tool that predicts protein-coding genes from DNA sequences).
- Then, use InterProscan to create a tabular. Interproscan is a batch tool to query the InterPro database. It helps identify and predict the functions of proteins by comparing them to known databases.
- Finally, discover SanntiS both to build genbank and especially to detect and annotate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

## The workflow itself

## Run the workflow

Import and run the following workflow https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/u/marie.josse/w/marine-omics-identifying-biosynthetic-gene-clusters

To know more on how to do that follow the tutorial https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/ecology/tutorials/marine_omics_bgc/tutorial.html

## Generate the RO-Crate 

Once you run the workflow you can generate the RO-Crate. To do so follow the tutorial https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/tutorials/ro-crate-in-galaxy/tutorial.html

## Shortcut Keys

- <kbd>?</kbd> activates help
- <kbd>Escape</kbd> leaves help
- <kbd>p</kbd> activates presenter mode
- <kbd>f</kbd> activates full screen mode
- <kbd>c</kbd> clones the slides into a popup

???

- The key to close the help isn't shown in the keyboard shortcuts, but it is the escape key.
- There are a number of other shortcuts which can be useful to know about.
- The clone window function creates a popup with a copy of the slides, this can be used to show the presenter notes on one screen, and the actual slides on another screen that learners can see.
