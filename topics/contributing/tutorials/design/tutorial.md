## Learning Outcomes (LOs)


What are Learning Outcomes?
- Statements expressing which KSAs learners will be able to demonstrate upon completion of a learning experience or a sequence of learning experiences
- What learners will be able to do for the end of a lesson and the teacher can in principle evaluate
- https://irds.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10071/f/clo.pdf


LOs should be SMART
* SMART?
    * Specific / Simple
    * Measurable
    * Achievable / Attainable
    * Realistic / Relevant
    * Time-bound / Transferable
* SMART LOs will be your roadmap as you plan your instructional strategies, write your content and **create assessments**


Writing LOs using ACTION verbs
* Think about what learners will be able to do by the end of a course that you will be able to evaluate

    By the end of the course learners will be able to …………………………………………………..………………</p>

* Avoid vers open to multiple interpretation
* Use a verb that describes an observable action

### Example

"By the end of the course learners will know the Pythagora's theorem"

* How to assess whether learners know the Pythagoras’ theorem?
* What do we mean by «knowing» the Pythagorean theorem?
    * They are able state it?
    * They are able explain it?
    * They are able apply it?
    * They are able demonstrate it?
    * They are able to use it in solving problem?
* It would make more sense to ask

What will learners be able to do to show they know the Pythagorean theorem?</p>

### Bloom’s Taxonomy & Action verbs

Will help to identify the cognitive load expected from learners

* 3 top levels: experts - critical thinking
* Below: 
* Bottom: novice


![Blooms'taxonomy](../../images/design/bloom_taxonomy.png)


Which kind of verbs you want to use for your training?

### Writing Learning Outcomes using assessable verbs

1. Think about what learners will be able to do by the end of instruction
2. Use the sentence: 

    By the end of the lesson, the successful learners will be able to …...</p>

3. Replace dots with a verb that you can assess (name, explain, solve, distinguish, etc.).
4. Avoid verbs that are open to many interpretations: e.g., appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Define audience, goal and outcomes (10 min)
>
> 1. Take the topic you choose
> 2. Define teaching objectives (describe your goals and intentions as the instructor )
> 3. Write learning outcomes (think about what learners will be able to do by the end of this instruction) - using Bloom’s taxonomy - actionable verbs
>
>    LO should be appropriate to the level of the target audience according to Bloom’s taxonomy. When you pick actionable verbs to what to expect – choose the appropriate level!
>
> 4. Identify the target audience and prerequisites
> 5. Identify the learning experiences
> 6. Start thinking about the content - but don’t spend time in preparing this yet
>

## Defining content

### Concept maps

Concept maps: rough and visual scheme on how the different concepts are linked

Concept maps can be used by trainers to help building content

Example 1: The n

![example of concept map](../..7images/design/nucleus_concept_map.jpg "Example of concept map to explain the nucleus")

* Number of nodes: 9
* Number of edges: 6 
* Total: 15 concepts

Connection with breaking training in small pieces (7+/2 concepts)

Concept maps help the trainer and helpers to connect things together

Concept maps begin with a main idea (or concept) and then branch out to show how that main idea can be broken down into specific topics.

Example 2: the FAIR principles

- Parking lot (keywords I want to discuss)
    * Research data
    * Research models
    * Findable
    * Accessible
    * Interoperable
    * Re-usable
- Question: What are FAIR principles?

![alt_text](../../images/design/fair_concept_map.png "image_tooltip")


Why concept maps?
* Include concepts and relationships to link concepts
* Good to start a concept map with a focus question - context
* Help to organize knowledge and to structure it

How to use concept maps?
* Concept maps: graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge
    * Tried to objective but depend on the trainer
    * Everyone has their one concept map
* Include concepts and relationships to link concepts
* Good to start a concept map with a focus question - context
* Help to organize knowledge and to structure it
* Good concept maps are built with iterations and feedback
* Joseph D. Novak , 1972

Example that Everyone has their own concept map
* Representation of the way to go from point A to point B from 2 persons living in the same city

Concept maps in curriculum/lesson/session planning
* They present  key concepts in a highly concise manner 
* This helps in the teaching plan to measure how much you can cover
* The hierarchical organization suggests a sequence to cover material

Further reading: [The Theory Underlying Concept Maps and How to Construct and Use Them](http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf)

Concept map can take into account the existing knowledge of learners and new concepts

(can play a role in the number of nodes/edges in the map)

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Draw a concept map (15 min - Silent working)
>
> *  Create a slide in the shared Google slidedeck
> * Draw a concept map of your topic of interest
> * Start with a question
> * Include 7 (+ - 2) concepts
> * Include relationships and cross-links between these concepts
> * Arrange it in a hierarchical structure with the key concepts on top
>
{: .hands_on}

When using concept maps to identify the number of items you are going to teach (7+-2 items) you have to COUNTS LINKS AS ITEMS!!!

Ask if difficulties, questions, thoughts to create the maps


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Give / receive feedback on concept maps (10 min - Group of 2 people)
>
> * Pair with someone
> * Check the concept name of your partner (see slide number above)
> * Write in comment on the slide
>     * One thing you are confuse/not sure about the map
>     * One thing you like/it is clear about the map
>
{: .hands_on}

### Content

- **Content collection**: collecting appropriate content to the needs and capabilities of your target audience
- **Content reduction**: one of the biggest challenges in designing training courses is the reduction of content to the training format. key points!


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Delivery planning (10 min - Silent working) 
>
> * Think if you want to make your training interactive 
> * Think whether you need or want to use a visual support (images)
> * Think whether you need to distribute material in advance to the audience 
> * Prepare for your choices
> * Be creative!
>
{: .hands_on}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Producing the content and the training material (15 min)
>
> It's now time to prepare the content of your mini-training.
> 
> The structure should be something likePrepare the content of your mini-training
> * 0:20 min - Introduction
> * 2:20 min - Topic
> * 0:20 min - Conclusion
>
> Use your concept and adapt as needed
{: .hands_on}

### How to give feedback on training

- Collect constructive feedback on content and presentation: positive and negative feedback using the following matrix as template:

    | + | -
    --- | --- | ---
    Content | |
    Presentation | |

* Listen actively and attentively
* Ask for clarification if you are confused
* Do not interrupt one another
* Challenge one another, but do so respectfully
* Critique ideas, not people
* Do not offer opinions without supporting evidence
* Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion
* Build on one another ’s comments; work toward shared understanding.
* Do not monopolise discussion.
* Speak from your own experience, without generalizing.
* If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.


> ### {% icon hands_on %} Give / receive feedback on mini-training delivery (15 min - Groups of 2 peoples)
>
>
> * Deliver each one your 3 minute session to others with 1 person noting down feedback in real-time
> * Describe your own feedback on your delivery
> * Provide feedback to the presenter
> * Write here any insights/thoughts/comments to share from your breakout room

# Session, course, curriculum design


## From a 2-min presentation to a lesson/session


Instruction design in 5 steps

![](../../images/design/instruction_design.png "5 phases of instructional design described by Nicholls et al in _Developing teaching and learning in higher education_. London, UK: Routledge. Pp 51-75")

### From learning outcomes to a lesson/session/course outline


**Learning outcomes (LO)**: knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA) that learners will be able to demonstrate after instruction

**Learning experiences (LE)**: lectures, scripts, exercises, a game, a video, group work,

**Assessment and feedback tools**: creative activities, written tests, observation, interaction, forms,…


* Well-defined and well-written LO will guide the whole structure 
* LO, LE, Assessment should be tightly-linked 
* This is not "teaching to the test", it's teaching to make the learners learn
* When all the LOs are expanded, you have your course outline


#### Lesson/session/course plan

Template to help developing plan:

Time | Activity | Description | Goal
--- | --- | --- | ---
 | | |
 | | |
 | | |


Example for a 1h15 session

Time | Activity | Description | Goal
--- | --- | --- | ---
9:00 - 9:15 | warm-up | Learners summaries the key points of each session from the previous day and answer questions from the audience. The instructor describes the plan of the day in detail | Retrieval from memory, repetition, get prepared for new topics, expose learners
9:15 - 9:25 | lecture | Python functions | Learning to write a function, about function input and output, and how to call a the function
9:20 - 10:00 | practical activity | Two exercises to be solved in pairs on a single computer. After solving the 1st exercise, the "driver" andr"navigator" will swap. 2 learners (1 / exercise) will display their solutions to the audience. Questions and discussion | Learners will be able to write and call a function calculating the distance between 2 points in the 3D space and a function taking the base and height of a triangle as input and returning its area
10:00 - 10:15 | wrap-up | Group test on functions (match input and output with specific functions: fill gaps in pieces of code). Game: repetition using ball throwing | Assess learning. Do we need to work more on functions? Repeat meaning and usage of all Python objects introduced so far

## Logistics that will help or hinder learning


Reproducibility of compute environments
* Identical installation setup on every computer and sufficient hardware (power and memory) to run the tools 
* Different courses, different compute requirements: Unix, R, Python, metagenomics, long read sequencing
* Installation process time-consuming and technically challenging
* Virtual machines, cloud computing, containers, software images
    * Allocate time (pre-sessions) to make sure installations are up and running

Training rooms for bioinformatics

Physical environment 
* Room geometry: seats’ quality, the lighting, the room temperature control, the stability of power and network connections
* Functionality : video, audio, drawing surfaces (whiteboard, flipchart paper), a corkboard  to pin materials 
* Hardware needs: power suppliers, network connections with a good quality wifi access


# Training material: sharing and making re-use possible

## FAIR principles

Data and models should be:
* Findable - can be searched for by the community after publication
* Accessible - can be read/downloaded by other researchers
* Interoperable - can be understood clearly in the context of the original experiment
* Re-usable - can be used by other researchers

Making training materials (slides, exercises, datasets, etc) FAIR 
* Findable - can be searched and found by the trainers community
* Accessible - can be read/downloaded by other trainers
* Interoperable - can be understood clearly in the context of the original course
* Re-usable - can be used by other trainers
