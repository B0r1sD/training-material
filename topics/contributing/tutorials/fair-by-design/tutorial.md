abbreviations:
  FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable
zenodo_link: https://zenodo.org/records/11548062
questions:
  - How to develop FAIR learning materials?
objectives:
  - Define FAIR learning objects
  - Adapt and mix FAIR learning objects
  - Identify licenses and attribute correspondingly
  - Structure comprehensive learning materials
  - Manage file formats and tools
  - Define metadata using a schema
  - Create and publish FAIR-by-Design learning materials
  - Collaborate with other instructors
  - Assess FAIR-ness of existing learning objects
time_estimation: 60M
key_points:
  - FAIR data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR).
  - FAIR data are as open as possible, and as closed as necessary.
  - The main objective of FAIR data is to increase data reuse by researchers.

# Main stages

## Stage 1 - Prepare
> Before anything else, preparation is the key to success!
{: .quote author="Alexander Graham Bell"}

### First things first: What is FAIR?


> <comment-title>Findable</comment-title>
> The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.
{: .comment title=""}


> <details-title>Accessible</details-title>
>
> The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.
>
{: .details }


> <tip-title>Interoperable</tip-title>
> The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.
> Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.
{: .tip}


> <question-title>Reusable</question-title>
>The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.
{: .question }


## Stage 2 - Discover

## Stage 3 - Design

### Time to brainstorm

### Structure is everything

### How to develop the learning content
