questions:
  - How to develop FAIR learning materials?
objectives:
  - Define FAIR learning objects
  - Adapt and mix FAIR learning objects
  - Identify licenses and attribute correspondingly
  - Structure comprehensive learning materials
  - Manage file formats and tools
  - Define metadata using a schema
  - Create and publish FAIR-by-Design learning materials
  - Collaborate with other instructors
  - Assess FAIR-ness of existing learning objects
time_estimation: 60M
key_points:
  - FAIR data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR).
  - FAIR data are as open as possible, and as closed as necessary.
  - The main objective of FAIR data is to increase data reuse by researchers.

# Main stages

## Stage 1 - Prepare
> Before anything else, preparation is the key to success!
{: .quote author="Alexander Graham Bell"}

### First things first: What is FAIR?


> <question-title>Findable</question-title>
> The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.
{: .question}


> <question-title>Accessible</question-title>
>
> The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.
>
{: .question}


> <question-title>Interoperable</question-title>
> The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.
> Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.
{: .question}


> <question-title>Reusable</question-title>
>The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.
{: .question }

### Adopt a metadata schema

><div class="Descriptive-info-fields" markdown="1">
>- **Title** =	The human readable name of the resource
>- **Abstract / Description** =	A brief synopsis about or description of the learning resource
>- **Author(s)** =	Name of entity(ies) authoring the resource
>- **Primary Language** =	Language in which the resource was originally published or made available
>- **Keyword(s)** =	Keywords or tags used to describe the resource
>- **Version Date** =	Version date for the most recently published or broadcast resource
></div>
><div class="Access-info-fields" markdown="1">
>- **URL to Resource** =	URL that resolves to the learning resource or to a "landing page" for the resource that contains important contextual information including the direct resolvable link to the resource, if applicable.
>- **Resource URL Type**	 = Designation of the identifier scheme used for the resource URL, e.g., DOI, ARK, Handle
>- **License** =	A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL
>- **Access Cost**	= Choice stating whether or not there is a fee for use of the resource (yes, no, maybe)
></div>
><div class="Educational-info-fields" markdown="1">
>- **Target Group (Audience)** =	Principal users(s) for which the resource was designed
>- **Learning Resource Type** =	The predominant type or kind that characterizes the learning resource
>- **Learning Outcome** =	Descriptions of what knowledge, skills or abilities a learner should acquire on completion of the resource
>- **Expertise (Skill) Level** =	Target skill level in the topic being taught; example values include beginner, intermediate, advanced
></div>


## Stage 2 - Discover

## Stage 3 - Design

### Time to brainstorm

### Structure is everything

### How to develop the learning content
