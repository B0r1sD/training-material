# Main stages

## Stage 1 - Prepare
> Before anything else, preparation is the key to success!
{: .quote author="Alexander Graham Bell"}

### First things first: What is FAIR?


> <question-title>Findable</question-title>
> The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.
{: .question}


> <question-title>Accessible</question-title>
>
> The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.
>
{: .question}


> <question-title>Interoperable</question-title>
> The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.
> Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.
{: .question}


> <question-title>Reusable</question-title>
>The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.
{: .question }

### Adopt a metadata schema

## Stage 2 - Discover
> Greater even than the greatest discovery is to keep open the way to future discovery.
{: .quote author="John Jacob Abel"}
### Get inspired
Reusable materials can be found anywhere. These are just some examples:
> <code-in-title>OER</code-in-title>
> [DOAB](https://directory.doabooks.org/)
> [MERLOT](https://www.merlot.org/merlot/index.htm)
> [OASIS](https://oasis.geneseo.edu/index.php)
> [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)
> [OERTX CORA](https://www.projectcora.org/)
> [GALILEO](https://oer.galileo.usg.edu/)
> [FORRT](https://forrt.org/)
{: .code-in}

> <code-in-title>EOSC</code-in-title>
> [EOSC Training catalogue on the EOSC Marketplace](https://search.marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/search/training?q=*)
> 
> Most EOSC projects have their own training catalogues and/or platforms...
{: .code-in}

> <code-in-title>General</code-in-title>
> [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) - content provided under a CC license
> [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) - a multi-disciplinary open repository
> [OSF](https://osf.io/) - a free, open research platform
{: .code-in}

### Potential for reuse
> <warning-title> Respect the licenses, to be respected!</warning-title>
> Materials with non-permissible licenses can be used for inspiration only. Materials with permissible licenses should be reused based on the license rules.
{: .warning}

### Don't forget the multimedia search
Different learners have different learning modalities (read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic). You should use all types of multimedia in your learning materials.
<a href="https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%202%20%E2%80%93%20Discover/03-Existing%20learning%20materials/03-Existing%20learning%20materials/" class="btn btn-dark text-white btn-lg btn-block">Start an in-depth training on the Discover stage....</a>

## Stage 3 - Design
> Design is intelligence made visible.
{: .quote author="Alina Wheeler"}
### Time to brainstorm

### Structure is everything

### How to develop the learning content

## Stage 4 - Produce


## Stage 5 - Publish
> Publishing is the art of working on a creative idea and turning it into a masterpiece​!
{: .quote author="Unknown"}

><warning-title>Publishing closed FAIR materials</warning-title>
> Having FAIR learning materials does not always mean that the materials are open to everyone and there are no costs or access rules attached. In this case the bundle that is going to be published in an open repository such as Zenodo should contain the following:
>  1. Syllabus - that contains all metadata that describe the materials and metadata should always be open
>  2. Accompanying files - optional - augment the description of the materials and describe the details when it comes to accessing and using the materials from a trainer perspective 
> Another alternative is to publish the materials in a closed repository where the corresponding access rules can be implemented.
{: .warning}

### Final preparations
><tip-title>Time to create the accompanying files</tip-title>
>These are <a href='https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%205%20–%20Publish/16-Publishing%20Preparations/16-Publishing%20Preparations/'>files</a> that are provided in the root of your learning materials and describe the content and define the rules of reuse.
{: .tip}


### Store in a repository

## Stage 6 - Verify
> You will find it a very good practice always to verify your references, sir!
{: .quote author="Martin Routh"}
### External QA
> <tip-title> A fresh set of eyes</tip-title>
> Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title> Don't forget to QA the LMS</tip-title>
>  The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title> Go through the QA checklists</tip-title>
> In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials.
{: .tip}

### FAIR or not FAIR, that is the question...

<br>
The questions marked as essential achieve bare minimum FAIRness." %} 

<div class="Essential-requirements" markdown="1">
- **Findable** =	Is the complete learning resource (including instructors info) registered or indexed in at least one searchable repository? Is it in a FAIR repository? Is metadata for the resource provided in both human- and machine-readable format (e.g JSON, XMLor YAML?
- **Accessible** =	Has an accessibility checker tool been utilised to improve the accessibility of all learning resource files (PDF, HTML, video, etc.)? Are access rules (authentication & authorisation) implemented for the learning resource?
- **Interoperable** = Is the RDA minimal (or domain specific) metadata schema used for the learning material description?</br> Is the resource available in open file formats which are tool agnostic and compatible with a wide variety of existing software?
- **Resuable** = Is there clear attribution for all reused resources with compatible licenses? Has the learning resource been made available for use by defining a permissable license or policy information that allows derivations?
</div>
<div class="Optional-requirements" markdown="1">
-  Did you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while developing the learning resource?
-  Are controlled vocabularies (CVs) used for describing the resource characteristics aligned with the chosen metadata schema?
-  Does the learning resource represent a complete learning object defined around minimum one learning objective?
-  Does the resource incorporate an instructor kit that aids in facilitating the process of others reusing learning material by offering helpful how-to guides?
    -  facilitator guide
    -  activities description
    -  assessment activities and strategy to assess
    -  general learning content or instructor notes
    -  lesson unit plan
    -  syllabus
-  Have you employed a versioning system to track and control changes in your materials?
-  Are the resource access rules (how to access, e.g. registration procedure) explicitly communicated to learners?
-  Is the learning resource searchable in at least one relevant catalogue? 
    -  Is it FAIR (can be searched based on metadata)?
-  Does the course include the possibility to provide feedback or comments from users and-or trainers/designers? 
    -  If so, do you regularly gather and analyse that feedback?
-  Does the resource adopt an open community approach regarding its quality and reachability?
-  Has the learning resource been checked by a third party regarding its learning experience quality?

### Feedback QA
