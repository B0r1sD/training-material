# Main stages

## Stage 1 - Prepare
> Before anything else, preparation is the key to success!
{: .quote author="Alexander Graham Bell"}

### First things first: What is FAIR?


> <solution-title>Findable</solution-title>
> The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.
{: .solution}


> <solution-title>Accessible</solution-title>
> The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.
{: .solution}


> <solution-title>Interoperable</solution-title>
> The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.
> Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.
{: .solution}


> <solution-title>Reusable</solution-title>
>The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.
{: .solution }

### Adopt a metadata schema

### Potential for reuse
> <warning-title> Respect the licenses, to be respected!</warning-title>
> Materials with non-permissible licenses can be used for inspiration only. Materials with permissible licenses should be reused based on the license rules.
{: .warning}

### Don't forget the multimedia search

Different learners have different learning modalities (read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic). You should use all types of multimedia in your learning materials.

<a href="https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_Book/4%20-%20FAIR-by-design%20learning%20materials%20creation/4.1%20-%20Workflow%20stages%20description/412-discover/" class="btn btn-dark text-white btn-lg btn-block">Go to FAIR-by-Design Methodology: Discover stage....</a>

## Stage 3 - Design

#### Concept map
Build a concept map of your learning materials aligning with the MVS profiles.

The aligned MVS profile can help you cristalize the learning objectives using MVS taxonomy.

Each MVS profile defines a list of technical and soft skills required for the profile. Think on how to incorporate both aspects in your learning materials.

## Stage 4 - Produce

> To contrive is nothing! To construct is something! To produce is everything! 
{: .quote author="Edward Rickenbackerâ"}

### Choose Tools & Formats
> <tip-title>Collaborative environment for team work</tip-title>
>  Choose an environment for producing the learning material that will enable multiple people to work on the same material at one. Two examples are workplace or GitHub (find out more <a href='https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%204%20â%20Produce/08-Development%20Tools/08-Introduction%20to%20Markdown%20and%20Git/'>here</a>). Replicate the folder tree in the environment and start using the provided templates to generate the content.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Granular versioning for easy rollback</tip-title>
>    Versioning helps you maintain control over your changes. If the collaborative environment does not provide versioning and history retention then keep a history of the files by adopting a naming convention such as combining the file name with an increasing version number.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Open file formats to foster reuse</tip-title>
>  For other people to reuse your materials they should be made available using open file formats (docx, pptx, pdf, md, html, etc.). If you use close file formats then you MUST clearly state the tools that have been used for development in your README file.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Multimodal content to reach all audience</tip-title>
>  Don't forget to include different types of multimedia to provide support for different learning modalities: read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Two file sets: editable + final</tip-title>
> Always work with and keep a history of your editable files. These are what matters for you and other instructors. The second set of final files should be obtained from the editable when needed (before distributing them to the learners). The final files should be kept on the learning platform only. In this way you don't need to worry about keeping the versions in sync.
{: .tip}

> <tip-title>Don't forget to support co-creation</tip-title>
> Truly FAIR learning materials should enable co-creation with external parties. If you don't use a collaborative environment that supports this from the start (such as GitHub), then think how are you going to enable this in the future and how are you going to deal with versioning then.
{: .tip}


### Plan to reuse existing material? 

#### Check the license

The existing materials is available under a CC license, but it is different than the one you plan to use for your materials...

><details-title>I want to reuse it as a whole</details-title>
>You can't use something that is licensed with ND (no derivatives). In this case you must follow the rules on combining and adapting CC material. 
>[Read more...](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#combining-and-adapting-cc-material)
{: .details}

><details-title>I want to reuse a small part of it</details-title>
> No problem, you can reuse any existing CC licensed material in your learning materials as long as the reused portion is used as a showcase or to make a specific point and it is not the core of your work. If the work is licensed with ND, do not modify it while reusing.

### Accessibility
><tip-title></tip-title>
>The developed learning materials should cover the widest range of learner variability including the ones that use or do not use assistive technology.

#### Standards
There are several standards that govern the rules on level of accessibility. Three conformance levels exist, you should aim for AA which is the middle one.

Most commonly used is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard version 2.1</a>.

PDF document accessibility is measured with a separate technical specification <a href="https://pdfua.foundation/en/why-pdf-ua/">PDF/UA (Universal Accessibility)</a>.

#### Use accessibility evaluation tools!

Accessibility evaluation tools are not perfect. Even if they say that all is ok, it does not mean that your content is truly accessible. But they are a very good starting point.

> <details-title>Slides</details-title>
> Use the integrated accessibility checker in Power Point:
> 1. Open an existing presentation in PowerPoint and review the content. 
> 2. Select the Review tab. 
> 3. Select Check Accessibility.
> 4. An Accessibility Checker pane will appear on the right with 'Inspection Results' displayed.

> <details-title>Web content</details-title>
> Choose from the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/list/) developed by W3C.
{: .details}

> <details-title>PDF document</details-title>
> Check accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Pro.

{: .quote author="Unknown"}

><warning-title>Publishing closed FAIR materials</warning-title>
> Having FAIR learning materials does not always mean that the materials are open to everyone and there are no costs or access rules attached. In this case the bundle that is going to be published in an open repository such as Zenodo should contain the following:
>  1. Syllabus - that contains all metadata that describe the materials and metadata should always be open
>  2. Accompanying files - optional - augment the description of the materials and describe the details when it comes to accessing and using the materials from a trainer perspective 
> Another alternative is to publish the materials in a closed repository where the corresponding access rules can be implemented.

### FAIR or not FAIR, that is the question...

#### Measure FAIRness

Use the FAIR-by-Design methodology QA checklist to check if you have followed the most important aspects of the methodology and managed to produce FAIR learning materials.

The questions marked as essential achieve bare minimum FAIRness. 

><details-title>Essential requirements</details-title>
> - **Findable** =	Is the complete learning resource (including instructors info) registered or indexed in at least one searchable repository? Is it in a FAIR repository? Is metadata for the resource provided in both human- and machine-readable format (e.g JSON, XMLor YAML?
> - **Accessible** =	Has an accessibility checker tool been utilised to improve the accessibility of all learning resource files (PDF, HTML, video, etc.)? Are access rules (authentication & authorisation) implemented for the learning resource?
> - **Interoperable** = Is the RDA minimal (or domain specific) metadata schema used for the learning material description? Is the resource available in open file formats which are tool agnostic and compatible with a wide variety of existing software?
> - **Reusable** = Is there clear attribution for all reused resources with compatible licenses? Has the learning resource been made available for use by defining a permissable license or policy information that allows derivations?
{: .details}

><details-title>Optional requirements</details-title>
> -  Did you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while developing the learning resource?
> - Â Are controlled vocabularies (CVs) used for describing the resource characteristics aligned with the chosen metadata schema?
> - Â Does the learning resource represent a complete learning object defined around minimum one learning objective?
> - Â Does the resource incorporate an instructor kit that aids in facilitating the process of others reusing learning material by offering helpful how-to guides?
>    - Â facilitator guide
>    - Â activities description
>    - Â assessment activities and strategy to assess
>    - Â general learning content or instructor notes
>    - Â lesson unit plan
>    - Â syllabus
> - Â Have you employed a versioning system to track and control changes in your materials?
> - Â Are the resource access rules (how to access, e.g. registration procedure) explicitly communicated to learners?
> - Â Is the learning resource searchable in at least one relevant catalogue?Â 
>    - Â Is it FAIR (can be searched based on metadata)?
> - Â Does the course include the possibility to provide feedback or comments from users and-or trainers/designers?Â 
>    - Â If so, do you regularly gather and analyse that feedback?
> - Â Does the resource adopt an open community approach regarding its quality and reachability?
> - Â Has the learning resource been checked by a third party regarding its learning experience quality?
