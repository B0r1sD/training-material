title: RMarkdown & RStudio

>
> As monocle3 is originally written in R, you can follow this tutorial simply by copying and pasting code from the GTN, but to make things easier, you can use the RMarkdown Notebook instead to be able to run the code directly as it was written, inside RStudio! This is recommended for users working locally in RStudio due to installation errors that might appear, but our interactive tools allow you to launch RStudio in Galaxy as well.

> > 1. You will need to download the tutorial notebook locally to your own computer. Simply go to the `Supporting Materials` section in the Overview box at the very beginning of this tutorial and click on `RMarkdown Notebook`. It will be downloaded to your computer as `single-cell-scrna-case_monocle3-rstudio.Rmd` file.

> > It may happen that you will encounter some problems with installation of monocle3 when using RStudio Galaxy instance or RStudio Cloud. It might be due to using older versions of R or required packages or lack of required dependencies. If it happens, you would need to carefully read the error messages and follow the suggestions. If you are facing any difficulties with installation process, it is recommended that you consult your problem with additional online resources. It is more likely that RStudio Cloud or Galaxy tool would fail rather than local RStudio. To make your analysis stress-free, you can follow the Jupyter Notebook instead, which should not give you installation issues.
