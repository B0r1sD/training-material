# Setting up the environment 

Alevin is a tool integrated with the salmon software, so first we need to get salmon. You can install salmon using bioconda, but in this tutorial we will show an alternative method - downloading the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases).

```bash
wget -nv https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/releases/download/v1.10.0/salmon-1.10.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```

Once you've downloaded a specific binary (here we're using version 1.10.0), just extract it like so:

```bash
tar -xvzf salmon-1.10.0_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
```


We're going to use Alevin {% cite article-Alevin %} for demonstration purposes, but we do not endorse one method over another.

## Get Data

We continue working on the same example data - a very small subset of the reads in a mouse dataset of fetal growth restriction {% cite Bacon2018 %} (see the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/results/tsne) and the [project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6945/)). For the purposes of this tutorial, the datasets have been subsampled to only 50k reads (around 1% of the original files). Those are two fastq files - one with transcripts and the onther one with cell barcodes. You can download the files by running the code below:

```bash
wget -nv https://zenodo.org/
wget -nv https://zenodo.org/
```

end

Additionally, to map your reads, you will need a transcriptome to align against (a FASTA) as well as the gene information for each transcript (a gtf) file. These files are included in the data import step below. 

```bash
wget -nv https://zenodo.org/
wget -nv https://zenodo.org/
```

You can also download these for your species of interest [from Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). Once you find the cDNA FASTA file you are interested in, right click on the link and choose "Copy link address" and paste it along the command `wget -nv`, then extract it using `tar`. Here is the example how to do it:

```bash
# Getting FASTA file
wget -nv https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/mus_musculus/cdna/
tar  
```
Do exactly the same to get the GTF file:

```bash
# Getting GTF file
wget -nv https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/gtf/mus_musculus
tar  
```

end

Why do we need FASTA and GTF files? 
To generate gene-level quantifications based on transcriptome quantification, Alevin and similar tools require a conversion between transcript and gene identifiers. We can derive a transcript-gene conversion from the gene annotations available in genome resources such as Ensembl. The transcripts in such a list need to match the ones we will use later to build a binary transcriptome index. If you were using spike-ins, you'd need to add these to the transcriptome and the transcript-gene mapping.

We will use the murine reference annotation as retrieved from Ensembl in GTF format. This annotation contains gene, exon, transcript and all sorts of other information on the sequences. We will use these to generate the transcript-gene mapping by passing that information to a tool that extracts just the transcript identifiers we need.


## Generate a transcript to gene map and filtered FASTA

You can have a look at the Terminal tab again. Has the package `atlas-gene-annotation-manipulation` been installed yet? If yes, you can execute the code cell below and while it's running, I'll explain all the parameters we set here. 

```bash
gtf2featureAnnotation.R -g gtf.gff -c fasta.fasta -d "transcript_id" -t "transcript" -f "transcript_id" -o map_code -l "transcript_id,gene_id" -r -e filtered_fasta_code 
```

In essence, [gtf2featureAnnotation.R script](https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/atlas-gene-annotation-manipulation) takes a GTF annotation file and creates a table of annotation by feature, optionally filtering a cDNA file supplied at the same time. Therefore the first parameter `-g` stands for "gtf-file" and requires a path to a valid GTF file. Then `-c` takes a cDNA file for extracting meta info and/or filtering - that's our FASTA! Where --parse-cdnas (that's our `-c`) is specified, we need to specify, using `-d`, which field should be used to compare to identfiers from the FASTA. We set that to "transcript_id" - feel free to inspect the GTF file to explore other attributes. We pass the same value in `-f`, meaning first-field, ie. the name of the field to place first in output table. To specify which other fields to retain in the output table, we provide comma-separated list of those fields, and since we're only interested in transcript to gene map, we put those two names ("transcript_id,gene_id") into `-l`. `-t` stands for the feature type to use, and in our case we're using "transcript". Guess what `-o` is! Indeed, that's the output annotation table - here we specify the file path of our transcript to gene map. We will also have another output denoted by `-e` and that's the path to a filtered FASTA. Finally, we also put `-r` which is there only to suppress header on output. Summarising, output will be a an annotation table, and a FASTA-format cDNAs file with unannotated transcripts removed.

Why filtered FASTA?
Sometimes it's important that there are no transcripts in a FASTA-format transcriptome that cannot be matched to a transcript/gene mapping. Salmon, for example,  used to produce errors when this mismatch was present. We can synchronise the cDNA file by removing mismatches as we have done above.


## Generate a transcriptome index

We will use Salmon in mapping-based mode, so first we have to build a salmon index for our transcriptome. We will run the salmon indexer as so:

```bash
salmon-latest_linux_x86_64/bin/salmon index -t filtered_fasta_code -i salmon_index_code -k 31
```

Where `-t` stands for our filtered FASTA file, and `-i` is the output the mapping-based index. To build it, the funciton is using an auxiliary k-mer hash over k-mers of length 31. While the mapping algorithms will make used of arbitrarily long matches between the query and reference, the k size selected here will act as the minimum acceptable length for a valid match. Thus, a smaller value of k may slightly improve sensitivity. We find that a k of 31 seems to work well for reads of 75bp or longer, but you might consider a smaller k if you plan to deal with shorter reads. Also, a shorter value of k may improve sensitivity even more when using selective alignment (enabled via the â€“validateMappings flag). So, if you are seeing a smaller mapping rate than you might expect, consider building the index with a slightly smaller k.

## Use Alevin

Time to use Alevin now! Alevin works under the same indexing scheme (as salmon) for the reference, and consumes the set of FASTA/Q files(s) containing the Cellular Barcode(CB) + Unique Molecule identifier (UMI) in one read file and the read sequence in the other. Given just the transcriptome and the raw read files, alevin generates a cell-by-gene count matrix (in a fraction of the time compared to other tools).

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> How does Alevin work in detail?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>
> >
> > Alevin works in two phases. In the first phase it quickly parses the read file containing the CB and UMI information to generate the frequency distribution of all the observed CBs, and creates a lightweight data-structure for fast-look up and correction of the CB. In the second round, alevin utilizes the read-sequences contained in the files to map the reads to the transcriptome, identify potential PCR/sequencing errors in the UMIs, and performs hybrid de-duplication while accounting for UMI collisions. Finally, a post-abundance estimation CB whitelisting procedure is done and a cell-by-gene count matrix is generated.

All the required input parameters are described in [the documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html), but for the ease of use, they are presented below as well:

- `-l`: library type (same as salmon), we recommend using ISR for both Drop-seq and 10x-v2 chemistry.

- `-1`: CB+UMI file(s), alevin requires the path to the FASTQ file containing CB+UMI raw sequences to be given under this command line flag. Alevin also supports parsing of data from multiple files as long as the order is the same as in -2 flag.

- `-2`: Read-sequence file(s), alevin requires the path to the FASTQ file containing raw read-sequences to be given under this command line flag. Alevin also supports parsing of data from multiple files as long as the order is the same as in -1 flag.

- `--dropseq` / `--chromium` / `--chromiumV3`: the protocol, this flag tells the type of single-cell protocol of the input sequencing-library.

- `-i`: index, file containing the salmon index of the reference transcriptome, as generated by salmon index command.

- `-p`: number of threads, the number of threads which can be used by alevin to perform the quantification, by default alevin utilizes all the available threads in the system, although we recommend using ~10 threads which in our testing gave the best memory-time trade-off.

- `-o`: output, path to folder where the output gene-count matrix (along with other meta-data) would be dumped.

- `--tgMap`: transcript to gene map file, a tsv (tab-separated) file â€” with no header, containing two columns mapping of each transcript present in the reference to the corresponding gene (the first column is a transcript and the second is the corresponding gene).

- `--freqThreshold`

- `--keepCBFraction`

- `--dumpFeatures`

We have also added some additional parameters, and their values are derived from the [Alevin Galaxy tutorial]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin/tutorial.md %}) after QC. 

Once all the above requirement are satisfied, Alevin can be run using the following command:

```bash
salmon-latest_linux_x86_64/bin/salmon alevin -l ISR -1 barcodes_701.fastq -2 transcript_701.fastq --dropseq  -i salmon_index_code -p 10 -o alevin_output_code --tgMap map_code --freqThreshold 3 --keepCBFraction 1 --dumpFeatures
```

> <warning-title>Process stopping</warning-title>
>  
> The command above will display the log of the process and will say "Analyzed X cells (Y% of all)". For some reason, running Alevin may sometimes cause problems in Jupyter Notebook and this process will stop and not go to completion. This is the reason why we use hugely subsampled dataset here - bigger ones couldn't be fully analysed (they worked fine locally though). The dataset used in this tutorial shouldn't make any issues when you're using Jupyter notebook through galaxy.eu, however might not work properly on galaxy.org. If you're accessing Jupyter notebook via galaxy.eu and alevin process stopped, just restart the kernel and that should help.

This is a study using the Drop-seq chemistry, however this tutorial is almost identical to a 10x chemistry. We will point out the one tool parameter change you will need to run 10x samples. This data is not carefully curated, standard tutorial data - it's real, it's messy, it desperately needs filtering, it has background RNA running around, and most of all it will give you a chance to practice your analysis as if this data were yours.


Alevin collapses the steps involved in dealing with dscRNA-seq into a single process. Such tools need to compare the sequences in your sample to a reference containing all the likely transcript sequences (a 'transcriptome'). This will contain the biological transcript sequences known for a given species, and perhaps also technical sequences such as 'spike ins' if you have those.

> <details-title>How does Alevin work?</details-title>
>
> To be able to search a transcriptome quickly, Alevin needs to convert the text (FASTA) format sequences into something it can search quickly, called an 'index'. The index is in a binary rather than human-readable format, but allows fast lookup by Alevin. Because the types of biological and technical sequences we need to include in the index can vary between experiments, and because we often want to use the most up-to-date reference sequences from Ensembl or NCBI, we can end up re-making the indices quite often. Making these indices is time-consuming! Have a look at the uncompressed FASTA to see what it starts with.

We now have:

* Barcode/ UMI reads
* cDNA reads
* transcript/ gene mapping
* filtered FASTA

We can now run Alevin. In some public instances, Alevin won't show up if you search for it. Instead, you may have to click the Single Cell tab at the left and scroll down to the Alevin tool. Alternatively, use Tutorial Mode as described above and you'll easily navigate to all the tools, and their versions will all be the tried and tested ones of this tutorial. It's often a good idea to check your tool versions. To identify which version of a tool you are using, select {% icon tool-versions %} 'Versions' and choose the appropriate version. In this case the tutorial was built with Alevin Galaxy Version 1.9.0+galaxy2.

For simplicity, when we refer to those files in the tutorial, we skip the information about tool and only use the second part of the name - in this case it would be simply *"whitelist"*. 
{: .comment}

This tool will take a while to run. Alevin produces many file outputs, not all of which we'll use. You can refer to the [Alevin documentation](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html) if you're curious what they all are, but we're most interested in is:

* the matrix itself (*per-cell gene-count matrix (MTX)* - the count by gene and cell)
* the row (cell/ barcode) identifiers (*row index (CB-ids)*) and
* the column (gene) labels (*column headers (gene-ids)*).

The overall mapping rate of the file is more like 50%, which is still quite poor, but for early Drop-Seq samples and single-cell data in general, you might expect a slightly poorer mapping rate. 10x samples are much better these days! This is real data, not test data, after all!

{% icon congratulations %} Congratulations - you've made an expression matrix! We could almost stop here. But it's sensible to do some basic QC, and one of the things we can do is look at a barcode rank plot.

# Basic QC

The question we're looking to answer here, is: "do we mostly have a single cell per droplet"? That's what experimenters are normally aiming for, but it's not entirely straightforward to get exactly one cell per droplet. Sometimes almost no cells make it into droplets, other times we have too many cells in each droplet. At a minimum, we should easily be able to distinguish droplets with cells from those without.

Now, the image generated here (400k) isn't the most informative - but you are dealing with a fraction of the reads! If you run the total sample (so identical steps above, but with significantly more time!) you'd get the image below.

![raw droplet barcode plots-total](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-raw_barcodes-total.png "Total sample - 32,579,453 reads - raw")

This is our own formulation of the barcode plot based on a [discussion](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/362#issuecomment-490160480) we had with community members. The left hand plots with the smooth lines are the main plots, showing the UMI counts for individual cell barcodes ranked from high to low. We expect a sharp drop-off between cell-containing droplets and ones that are empty or contain only cell debris. Now, this data is not an ideal dataset, so for perspective, in an ideal world with a very clean 10x run, data will look a bit more like the following taken from the lung atlas (see the [study in Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/results/tsne) and the [project submission](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6653/)).

![raw droplet barcode plots - lung atlas](../../images/scrna-casestudy/wab-lung-atlas-barcodes-raw.png "Pretty data - raw")

In that plot, you can see the clearer 'knee' bend, showing the cut-off between empty droplets and cell-containing droplets.

The right hand plots are density plots from the first one, and the thresholds are generated either using [dropletUtils](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html) or by the method described in the discussion mentioned above. We could use any of these thresholds to select cells, assuming that anything with fewer counts is not a valid cell. By default, Alevin does something similar, and we can learn something about that by plotting just the barcodes Alevin retains.

In experiments with relatively simple characteristics, this 'knee detection' method works relatively well. But some populations (such as our sample!) present difficulties. For instance, sub-populations of small cells may not be distinguished from empty droplets based purely on counts by barcode. Some libraries produce multiple 'knees' for multiple sub-populations. The [emptyDrops](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y) method has become a popular way of dealing with this. emptyDrops still retains barcodes with very high counts, but also adds in barcodes that can be statistically distinguished from the ambient profiles, even if total counts are similar. In order to ultimately run emptyDrops (or indeed, whatever tool you like that accomplishes biologically relevant thresholding), we first need to re-run Alevin, but prevent it from applying its own less than ideal thresholds.

To use emptyDrops effectively, we need to go back and re-run Alevin, stopping it from applying it's own thresholds. Click the re-run icon {% icon galaxy-refresh %} on any Alevin output in your history, because almost every parameter is the same as before, except you need to change the following:

Alevin outputs MTX format, which we can pass to the dropletUtils package and run emptyDrops. Unfortunately the matrix is in the wrong orientation for tools expecting files like those produced by 10X software (which dropletUtils does). We need to 'transform' the matrix such that cells are in columns and genes are in rows.

Inspect {% icon galaxy-eye %} the **Gene Information** object in the history.

# emptyDrops

emptyDrops {% cite article-emptyDrops %} works with a specific form of R object called a SingleCellExperiment. We need to convert our transformed MTX files into that form, using the DropletUtils Read10x tool:
