Pseudobulk analysis is a powerful technique that bridges the gap between single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data. It involves aggregating gene expression data from groups of cells within the same biological replicate, such as a mouse or patient, typically based on clustering or cell type annotations ({% cite Murphy2022 %}).

A key advantage of this approach in differential expression analysis is that it avoids treating individual cells as independent samples, which can underestimate variance and lead to inflated significance or overly optimistic p-values ({% cite Squair2021 %}). This occurs because cells from the same biological replicate are inherently more similar to each other than cells from different samples. By grouping data into pseudobulk samples, the analysis aligns with the experimental design, as in bulk RNA-seq, leading to more reliable and robust statistical results ({% cite Murphy2022 %}).

Beyond enhancing statistical validity, pseudobulk analysis enables the identification of cell-type-specific gene expression and functional changes across biological conditions. It balances the detailed resolution of single-cell data with the statistical power of bulk RNA-seq, providing insights into the functional transcriptomic landscape relevant to biological questions. Overall, for differential expression analysis in multi-sample single-cell experiments, pseudobulk approaches demonstrate superior performance compared to single-cell-specific DE methods ({% cite Squair2021 %}). 

In this tutorial, we will guide you through a pseudobulk analysis workflow using the **Decoupler** and **edgeR** tools available in Galaxy ({% cite Badia-iMompel2022 %}) ({% cite Liu2015 %}). These tools facilitate functional and differential expression analysis, and their output can be integrated with other Galaxy tools to visualize results, such as creating Volcano Plots, which we will also cover in this tutorial.

# Let's Get the Data!

## Overview of the Data

Our data was extracted from the publication titled _"Elevated Calprotectin and Abnormal Myeloid Cell Subsets Discriminate Severe from Mild COVID-19"_ ({% cite Silvin2020 %}). This dataset was chosen because it was utilized by the developers of the `decoupler` tool for pseudobulk aggregate analysis ({% cite decoupler-pseudobulk %}).

Pseudobulk analysis is an advanced method in single-cell data analysis. For this tutorial, we assume familiarity with common single-cell data formats, such as AnnData or Seurat objects, and experience analysing single-cell data, including clustering and annotating cell types.

If you're new to these concepts, we recommend exploring our other tutorials before performing pseudobulk analysis:
- [Clustering 3K PBMCs with Scanpy]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-scanpy-pbmc3k/tutorial.md %}): Learn how to cluster and annotate cells in Galaxy using our single-cell tools.
- [Combining single cell datasets after pre-processing]({% link topics/single-cell/tutorials/scrna-case_alevin-combine-datasets/tutorial.md %}): Understand how to combine multiple datasets into one AnnData object and add metadata from single-cell experiments.

The data object, which you will import from Zenodo into Galaxy via the provided link, has been preprocessed, analysed, and annotated. It includes the following key observations:
- **cell_type**: The type of cell identified.
- **disease**: Indicates whether the sample is a control or corresponds to a COVID-19 condition.
- **individual**: The individual donor or sample identifier.
- **sex**: The sex of the individual.

# Generation of the Pseudobulk Count Matrix with Decoupler

In this step, our goal is to perform a "bioinformatic cell sorting" based on the annotated clusters of the single-cell data.

To start a pseudobulk analysis, ensure that the AnnData object you will use contains all the necessary metadata for ***"pseudobulking"***. For example, key annotations, such as cell type, condition, disease, and batch, should be present. Most importantly, the AnnData object has to include a layer with the raw counts of gene expression.

Raw counts are crucial for generating accurate pseudobulk aggregates. Since single-cell data is typically normalized after annotation, itâ€™s important to preserve the raw counts in the AnnData object before normalization steps if you would like to perform a pseudobulk analysis later on. These raw counts are directly used by tools like **Decoupler** to generate the pseudobulk count matrix. Note that normalized count matrices should not be used with Decoupler, even if the tool appears to process them successfully.

> <tip-title> Missing Raw Counts? </tip-title>
>
> If your AnnData object lacks raw counts, you can use the **[AnnData Operations](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/ebi-gxa/anndata_ops/anndata_ops/1.9.3+galaxy0)** tool on the **[Single Cell Galaxy instance](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu)**. This tool allows you to copy the `.X` matrix into a new layer that you may assign a new label, for e.g., `counts` or `raw_counts`, making it available as a parameter for Decoupler.
>
> Importantly, ensure that the copying of this matrix as a raw counts layer is done carefully and correctly. To verify that your AnnData object contains the necessary raw counts layer, you can use the **[Inspect AnnData Object](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/anndata_inspect/anndata_inspect/0.10.9+galaxy0)** tool. This tool helps confirm the presence of raw counts and other essential metadata in your AnnData object before proceeding with pseudobulk analysis.

# Differential Expression Analysis (DE) with edgeR

The tool **edgeR** is commonly used for differential expression (DE) analysis of pseudobulk aggregates in single-cell RNA-seq studies ({% cite Chen2024 %}). It calculates gene dispersions based on the total counts for each gene and adjusts these estimates using an approach called empirical Bayes. This method improves reliability by pooling information across all genes in the dataset to stabilize dispersion estimates, particularly for genes with low counts or limited data. By "borrowing strength" from the behavior of other genes, empirical Bayes reduces the risk of overestimating or underestimating variability, ensuring more robust and accurate results ({% cite Chen2024 %}). Differential expression is then evaluated using an exact test for the negative binomial distribution, which is similar to Fisherâ€™s exact test but modified to handle the variability typically seen in RNA-seq data ({% cite Chen2024 %}). 

In addition to exact tests, edgeR employs generalized linear models (GLMs), which allow for the analysis of more complex experimental designs. GLMs model gene counts as a function of experimental conditions (e.g., treatment groups or time points) and estimate how these conditions influence gene expression. Likelihood-based methods, such as quasi-likelihood (QL) approaches, are central to this framework. Standard likelihood methods evaluate the fit of the model to the data, while quasi-likelihood methods add an extra layer by explicitly accounting for biological and technical variability, improving the reliability of DE results. These models allow edgeR to identify subtle expression differences while controlling for overdispersion in the data ({% cite Chen2016 %}).

Several plots can be generated to assist in understanding the data and the results of the analysis, including MDS, BCV, QL, and MD plots. These visualizations provide insights into sample relationships, variability, and differential expression, and will be explained further in the tutorial. With these concepts in mind, let's now perform our DE analysis using our edgeR tool in Galaxy!

# Volcano Plot

In this step, we will use the sanitized output from the previous steps to generate a Volcano Plot, which visualizes the relationship between statistical significance (P-value) and fold change (LogFC) for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The input file for the Volcano Plot must include four essential columns: _FDR (adjusted P-value), P-value (raw), Log Fold Change, and Gene Symbols (Labels)._ As long as these columns are present, the Volcano Plot can be generated successfully.

## What are the results of the Volcano Plot?

Let's take a moment to interpret the Volcano Plot:
![Volcano Plot](../../images/pseudobulk-analysis/VolcanoPlot.png)
- Which genes are most significant?
- How does the fold change correlate with the P-values?
- Are there any unexpected patterns?

# Subsetting Samples from the Original AnnData Object

In our previous analysis, we found that only one gene, **MTND1P23**, was identified as downregulated in our contrast. This result was obtained by "bulking" **all** cell types from our dataset and performing a differential expression analysis comparing normal vs. COVID-19 samples.

Now, what if we refine our approach? For instance, instead of analysing all cell types together, what happens if we focus on a specific cluster, such as **T cells**, and perform the same comparison: normal vs. COVID-19? Would the results remain the same, or would this approach reveal additional insights?

## Extracting observations of interest as AnnData object 

> <hands-on-title> Use Manipulate AnnData Tools to extract observations </hands-on-title>

> 1. Use the {% tool [Manipulate AnnData](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/anndata_manipulate/anndata_manipulate/0.10.9+galaxy0) %} tool with the following parameters:
>    - *"Annotated data matrix"*: `AnnData for Pseudobulk` (Your preprocessed, analysed, and annotated AnnData object)  
>    - *"Function to manipulate the object"*: `Filter observations or variables`  
>    - *"What to filter?"*: `Observations (obs)` (For filtering cells, select Observations (obs))  
>    - *"Type of filtering?"*: `By key (column) values`  
>    - *"Key to filter"*: `cell_type` (the label that identifies cell annotations in our AnnData)  
>    - *"Type of value to filter"*: `Text`  
>    - *"Filter"*: `equal to`  
>    - *"Value"*: `T cell` (the name of the cluster of interest for subset analysis)
{: .hands_on}

After using the {% tool [Manipulate AnnData](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/anndata_manipulate/anndata_manipulate/0.10.9+galaxy0) %} tool to subset the cell type of interest, go back to the top of this tutorial to the hands-on **Pseudobulk with Decoupler** step, and you may perform once again the same steps in this smaller AnnData object that now should only include your T cells. Results from this analysis will correspond to differential expression between conditions only for T cells.

# Key Takeaways and Recommendations

## Key Takeaways
- **Pseudobulk Analysis Advantage:** Pseudobulk analysis bridges single-cell and bulk RNA-seq approaches, combining high resolution with statistical robustness.
- **Importance of Metadata:** Proper annotation and metadata inclusion (e.g., cell types, conditions) are needed for generating pseudobulk matrices.
- **Role of Decoupler:** The Decoupler tool can generate pseudobulk matrices, offering flexibility in filtering and visualization.
- **Strength of edgeR:** edgeR provides robust differential expression analysis for pseudobulk data, accounting for biological and technical variability.
- **Visualization and Interpretation:** Tools like Volcano Plots enhance interpretation by highlighting significant genes and trends in differential expression.

## Recommendations
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure raw counts are preserved in your AnnData object before pseudobulk analysis.
   - Verify the presence of important metadata fields to ensure meaningful grouping and contrasts.
2. **Focus on Subsets:** 
   - Analyse subsets of cell types or clusters for more granular insights. For example, pseudobulk analysis focused on specific immune cell populations can reveal subtle but important expression changes.
3. **Quality Control:**
   - Always inspect the outputs of Decoupler (e.g., pseudobulk plots and filtering summaries) to confirm data integrity and address outliers.
   - Use edgeRâ€™s diagnostic plots (e.g., MDS, BCV) to check for batch effects or unexpected variability.
4. **Follow-Up Analysis:**
   - Consider functional analysis (e.g., GO enrichment, pathway analysis) for the differentially expressed genes to link expression changes to biological processes.
   - Use visualization tools, such as heatmaps or boxplots, to further explore expression trends in key genes.
5. **Future Applications:**
   - Pseudobulk analysis can be extended to multi-condition experiments, time-course data, or other cell-type-specific investigations.
