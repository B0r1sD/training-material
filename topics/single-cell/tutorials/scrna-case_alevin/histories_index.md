# Answer Key Histories

If you get stuck, you can first check your history against an exemplar history.

(Insert drop-down menu here).

First, import the target history.

{% snippet histories_import.md %}

Next, compare the answer key history with your own history.

{% snippet histories_side_by_side_view.md %}

You can compare there, or if you're really stuck, you can also click and drag a given dataset to your history to continue the tutorial from there.

{% snippet histories_copy_dataset.md %}

You can also use our handy troubleshooting guide.

{% analysis_troubleshooting.md %}
