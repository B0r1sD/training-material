To discuss with like-minded scientists, join our Matrix/Element chatroom to discuss with fellow users of Galaxy single cell analysis tools!

[![Matrix](/training-material/topics/single-cell/images/matrix-badge.svg)](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_galaxy-single-cell:gitter.im)

We also post new tutorials / workflows there from time to time, as well as any other news.
