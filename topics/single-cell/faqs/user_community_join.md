To discuss with like-minded scientists, join our Matrix/Element chatroom to discuss with fellow users of Galaxy single cell analysis tools!

[![Matrix](/training-material/topics/single-cell/images/matrix-badge.svg)](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_galaxy-single-cell:gitter.im)

We also post new tutorials / workflows there from time to time, as well as any other news.

If you'd like to contribute ideas, requests or feedback as part of the wider community building single-cell and spatial resources within Galaxy, you can also join our [Single cell & sPatial Omics Community of Practice](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/singlecell/).
