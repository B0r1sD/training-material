  "questions": [
    "Which special challenges does one encounter during sequence data analysis of pox viruses?",
    "How can standard workflows for viral mutation calling and consensus generation be adapted to the particularities of pox viruses?",
    "How can viral consensus sequences, multiple-sequence alignments and mutation calls be generated from each other and used to answer questions about the data?"
  ],
  "objectives": [
    "Learn how to deal with pox virus genomes inverted terminal repeats through a combination of wet lab protocol and tailored bioinformatics",
    "Construct a sample consensus genome from mapped reads",
    "Explore a recombinant pox virus genome via a multiple-sequence alignment of consensus genome and references and through lists of mutations derived from it"
  ],
  "time_estimation": "4H",
  "key_points": [
    "Compared to other viruses, analysis of sequencing data from pox viruses is complicated by the rather large genome size and by the presence of inverted terminal repeats, but well-designed wet lab and bioinformatic workflows can handle these particularities.",
    "Galaxy and its huge set of tools are flexible enough to handle half-genome sequencing data efficiently.",
    "A mapping-based approach can result in high-quality consensus genome reconstructions from pox virus sequencing data and appears promising even when dealing with recombinant samples."
