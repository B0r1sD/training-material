If you have not purged a history and have only deleted it, it is possible to 'undelete' it and reverse or undo the deletion. To do so:

1. Select "Histories" from the activity bar of the left
2. Toggle "Advanced search"
3. Click "Deleted"
4. Click on the title of the history you want to un-delete, and un-delete it.
